1
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:44.399
SHI.42.South.06: It is a warning already. That's the that I I okay, let's put it on. Watch out. I mean, please help us to deliver that message through to her still, already in the career staff. And she can still change the attitude.

2
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.180
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. yeah.

3
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.990
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: into the next one. I've jumped all you being into that?

4
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.629
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Are you with us right now?

5
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:20.930
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: maybe let's move to the next one

6
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:43.359
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and the the the the the the the

7
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:59.979
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to a lot of internal process. So very challenging for that for me. but overall we like to say one. So it's it's part of the job in such a complicated space.

8
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.400
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, no.

9
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:15.599
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright! Let's move to the next one. on the next page.

10
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hello! Are you with us?

11
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.470
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If not, then move to Jerry's head

12
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.940
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and see

13
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:52.169
SHI.42.South.06: erez agmoni. Yeah. So Jerry, I was promoted the last cycle. And currently he is actually on a associate program in the Us. So he he took some. He took some like a Ora and the occasions, and he just settled down 101

14
00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:05.140
SHI.42.South.06: I. From a first off of May in the Us. He started his case last week on confidential entities. So far the set for that is okay.

15
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.419
SHI.42.South.06: not too much to after it.

16
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.930
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you. that's why she went to it to go.

17
00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.790
Zhigang Shi: Yeah, Wendy, is on utmost case.

18
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.089
Zhigang Shi: She received a

19
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.589
Zhigang Shi:  quite with I I was just surprised right there she got the 3.

20
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.599
Zhigang Shi: But anyway I think, for all she got the very good feedback from Utah's case.

21
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.729
Zhigang Shi: That was the calibration.

22
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, this coverage of Hong Kong.

23
00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:01.429
Zhigang Shi: the recent kind of version. Okay? Because I just talked to someone last week. I I I it wasn't. I wasn't aware of. There will be a screen.

24
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.260
Zhigang Shi: okay, anyway.

25
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.389
Zhigang Shi: But the but but the the big platform to me is quite good. So basically

26
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:36.840
Zhigang Shi: it, it's a one year long term program. But it's a small team. So everybody has to stand out and be responsible for it more or more to, and also working directly with client Wendy was in charge of a dealer annual conference. And she basically has to lay out the over, run down the the material and a and and and have the kind of where

27
00:04:36.840 --> 00:05:05.080
Zhigang Shi: we're prepared for the speech. So everything that is run by Wendy with not so much I will see support for all Supervisor supervision from from from Ppl. And and I think that she's quite intended and able to do it. I think it's it's quite good. The only thing I, I, I to her, is about to trying to find a window to finish the the Cp. And she's aware of that. And and

28
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.160
Zhigang Shi: yeah.

29
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, so I'll check.

30
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.209
Michelle Ma: okay, hear me?

31
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:35.270
Michelle Ma: Yeah. To be honest, I'm not aware of this collaboration problem. I need to talk to. Gary later on. The you know. what's a lot of time? But in general, just like it did not that her performance on the case was continuously very good. And and then I actually, I can always expect highest quality, you know. from when this work

32
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:58.839
Michelle Ma: the only thing maybe we need to encourage more is presenting from from senior clients, and also public privacy. We did not give a too much to many chances, but so, going forward, I would ask for to present more influence of the senior clients, but in general I think she is a a very good quality as a senior associate. And yeah, in terms of

33
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.339
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thank you. And I'm moving to the next one. Joyce, too. I'm good.

34
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:15.839
Hanhui Xie: Yeah. Joyce joined the B. C. As a fresh graduated Ph. D. And then now she is a has 5 months tenure.

35
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.209
Hanhui Xie: and so far she has 3 case data

36
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:29.759
Hanhui Xie: and all of them but And she is now working on the first case I have a talked to the 4 Ppls. She ever worked with

37
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:36.690
Hanhui Xie: surprising. All of them get very negative feedback. and the feedbacks are very consistent.

38
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.220
Hanhui Xie: I think that's a poor working attitude and a self awareness has been a major concern

39
00:06:43.450 --> 00:07:06.939
Hanhui Xie: The first pointer is the idea. She's very picky about what the kind of task should be assigned to her. In her opinion, taking expert notes, interview notes cleaning our data kinds of low value work should not be assigned to her, and in the first case she even wrote after herself, due to the heavy workload of interview notes.

40
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.279
Hanhui Xie: and the the second call into it is about a slides.

41
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:29.809
Hanhui Xie: she's like a channel a. Your tombdows in the Asian show. When P. O. Send her that me slides, she will directly send it the slides to production team. Maybe you could opinion that the format in this kind of low value what it should not be assigned to her

42
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.530
Hanhui Xie: and

43
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.530
Hanhui Xie: and the further comment, if they are like a

44
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:55.630
Hanhui Xie: all the Tpos common to do that, it feel very difficult to have efficient a communication with her. If a PP. I find her deliverable with the low quality or not in the right direction and try to give her comments. She will be very defensive.

45
00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:13.170
Hanhui Xie: and in her second case, I see, supervised her and the she told me that he will. Needed to spend a 2, 2 to 3 h per day persuading her to revise the content, and that makes him very exhausting.

46
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:33.600
Hanhui Xie: and also because you, in her third case, that she she directly communicated with the client and with the not involved Ppl, a lot of meetings and emails. And then she got a formal complaint from client team in email.

47
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.530
Hanhui Xie: And the the 3 Ppls all said that they won't test that.

48
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:54.129
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think I think that's That's also very consistent with what we heard and and felt. I I think, in her first case she she scheme directly to sapphire. And after 250,

49
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:59.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: basically, it's the same same thing as how we said she. She tried to roll herself off.

50
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:16.040
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. And I think all that that Another case I think that the nest, in case of Monday I may be can provide more, input, I think, they. They also wanted to roll roll off already. she, she is really an

51
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.939
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: very I I surprised a negative suppressed.

52
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:25.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And this is the case where we see some

53
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:44.509
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: What we heard outline is the way she communicates

54
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.029
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and but they they all go.

55
00:09:48.320 --> 00:10:06.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: However, I don't think we should. We threaten that. Such behavior we should stop But she's only 5 months, right? So

56
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.020
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's how cute.

57
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:16.439
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. Surprised that she was not on risk like that.

58
00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:26.509
SHI.42.South.06: She's only 5. She's my. She's new with us. okay, so

59
00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:45.230
Yue Hong Zhang: that looks like the case where you know, for detective feedback is quite helpful, right? Because the 2031 actually doesn't give the clear answer to that. It seems like it's a might be difficult to to find another.

60
00:10:53.260 --> 00:11:08.460
Hanhui Xie: It's actually very service, because based on my communication with her, I found it that this this lady is on straw, very strong personality. If we we directly give her Ct. And she will definitely make us sing in social media

61
00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the

62
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:21.159
SHI.42.South.06: not to manage it right now we don't compromise.

63
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:31.949
Yue Hong Zhang: I agree. I think we should not compromise the decision based on our potential reaction. Right? Emotional or not.

64
00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:40.149
Lin An: we have a professional team. We have a professional team to communicate and deal with it. Right? I think.

65
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.690
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: yeah.

66
00:11:52.570 --> 00:12:11.270
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. So so halfway, I I agree with you. It it might be a difficult case to handle. However, we should not, to, you know, not be doing it because of it right? So we will try to be careful to manage the transition process, however, for such profile we should not be threatened. because of this.

67
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:24.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this year we have a let's go some very difficult cases some of them. Indeed, they do the very extreme things to threat from the company threat to even the Hr, however, we will. Just, I think.

68
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:35.999
SHI.42.South.06: okay, yeah. So we are saying that to 10 min before probation.

69
00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.430
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So how about the offline discussion? About how to handle it?

70
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.190
Hanhui Xie: Okay.

71
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright. that going to next one Jeff, really.

72
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.730
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: which?

73
00:12:50.780 --> 00:13:14.440
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: so so, Jeffrey? I say, roll pretty well. I'm sending 4 months in now. I think he's he, you know. He's he's a sort of Bcg baby, so speak. he's got the call consulting skill set Ps. And I very strong good so communication process to slight rising needs bit more

74
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:35.049
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: confidence in his actual oral communications generally, I would say on on the right track. The big challenge that Jeffrey has at the moment is getting availability. So, for example, he was on the mirror, for the whole case got a good result. As as a 2,

75
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.239
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: but didn't get any availability for that. So

76
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:48.469
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: we need to find a way to get Jeffrey, you know, stop to more cases. rather than you know, either being invest in cases or or to be.

77
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:54.519
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: So, that's something that maybe we can take it offline and and see how we can get that.

78
00:13:54.550 --> 00:14:02.329
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: He actually gave you some some some

79
00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:06.899
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So because due to case budget issues.

80
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:22.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  yeah. And yes, I mean all we? there's some we. We put him on as partially available because of his previous

81
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:28.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the stopping issues. I mean, it was hard to get himself.

82
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:36.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so I mean he keeps on the the good performance, I mean, which we should have can guest document

83
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:40.760
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: perfect. Thank you.

84
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.349
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right. so moving to next one dinos and Jeffrey.

85
00:14:51.220 --> 00:15:17.959
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Good So yeah, Diana, So she she just recently promote to essay. And then the first case is it's a Pr case also, it's feedback strong psi communications. also very effective. So like demonstrate the same strength that that he she used to demonstrate that her a 10 year also some areas for improvement feedback. What is being

86
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:29.259
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: the more forward. Okay, if I said, well, being more than here to like different clients, and so on. But she's focusing quite well. So on the right track.

87
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:36.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright. thank you. That's why you

88
00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:50.259
Shelley Liu: He has been a very consistently strong, or even like the I think star performer, that type of person. I think that's starting from her 8 10 years.

89
00:15:50.340 --> 00:16:04.670
Shelley Liu: So how they also on the line so she could provide for the for the high in case, but she is pretty well from all the app when that after I took over her

90
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:30.289
Shelley Liu: like well rounded, I think, for there's one specific request for hiding that she would like to learn about the detailed requirement for her next level promotion, especially the vulnerability issue, like the requirement for Fpa. That's clear. But for Ipa's thickness, that kind of whether there is any requirement on that.

91
00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:45.319
Shelley Liu: because she has been stuffed on a Pmo project that's gonna be pretty long. So she's wondering whether, for her next level promotion whether there's any requirements for strategy case and etc., that kind of requirements.

92
00:16:45.590 --> 00:17:08.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: well for Hyen's case. if if the Ipa and Fpa could be. it could be finished, then I think it should be fine that as for any of you as high as our home grown essay, and she's quite strong on all those credit. Uk in the past.

93
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So again, the very short

94
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:18.449
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: short period of time in us. A, do we still require her to get off the piano case

95
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:19.700
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and

96
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:23.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: get getting into a strategy?

97
00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:31.520
Okay?

98
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.769
Shelley Liu: Sure I I can talk to you guys. I I'll fly after for for this matter.

99
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.999
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, sure. we're going to next to a long way. I'm Jessie.

100
00:17:44.170 --> 00:18:06.340
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah, I see more. I was doing good I got a quite a positive feedback. And he is quite good in the analytical skills and also communication. the the area for improvements. I should say. first of all, that the Pm. Would the require him to have a little bit

101
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:19.759
Jeffrey Gao: planning on. He's more due in in the beginning. So a little bit early planning for for his module, and the signal for is regarding the English slides. Writing to be a little bit more precise

102
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.989
Jeffrey Gao: and other than that, I think overall. He is doing doing good.

103
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay? we need to next one.

104
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:55.000
Kay Tang:  yes, jing! Chow has been doing a good job so far. I think if you look at availability and his rating. it's pretty strong So I talked to the Ppls. for now. he's being on my far, and now it's on sound and detail. so all very positive feedback, the only thing that for him to improve, for now

105
00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:23.559
Kay Tang: it's data. He got a background of Kt, so expertise, wise. He's strong. So sometimes it it, there's a tendency that he flows into his habit to talk about all those areas that he's familiar with. So going forward, maybe to expand more into different areas, different topics, so that he can be more well rounded. So that's the only thing that we need to be aware of. I did other than that. I think he's well on track.

106
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.990
SHI.42.South.06: that one. No screen.

107
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.020
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That's why Ryan, Joel, J,

108
00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:45.129
Jay Lao: yeah, I think. Ryan, it's a similar case as jin child he is he used to be kt, then the transition to a and then promoted the essay. he's very experienced in in popular issues.

109
00:19:45.310 --> 00:20:00.399
Jay Lao: I think. he he recently stopped on projects many, many all pop is is, it's very satisfied with his performance as you can see solid rating very high availability.

110
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:18.949
Jay Lao: So I guess he's he's well on track at this stage of his career. It's just as a Cp wise he needs to. He needs to finish that, and also suggest him to try some more of the strategy projects to to diversify some of his expertise. But other than that well, on trial.

111
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.209
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thank you good next one it will be your chart.

112
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:37.969
Richard Guo: Yeah. And then think she's well on track Her availability is is very high so he should very re staffable

113
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:48.630
Richard Guo: so even only you have 4 months tenu essay she or I got like one me her in her cohort.

114
00:20:49.180 --> 00:21:05.420
Richard Guo: So I I I saying, and she is now in a long case of aging bank case. I think the Ppl. Will provide quite positive feedback. So summarizing, Allen is is really and has good potential

115
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.629
Richard Guo: to be to be on that level.

116
00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.170
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thank you. Moving to next page

117
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:27.039
Jay Lao: sofina. I think she is very new just so recently graduated as

118
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:51.589
Jay Lao: Phd. she only had one case experience. I think it's it's It's I think she's average level in terms of a new essay need to push a little bit But I wanna say she's a problematic because it's just too new a job for her. As as a matter of fact, I just staff her on my recent case as investment, so I will keep

119
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.110
Jay Lao: coaching and monitoring her

120
00:21:54.750 --> 00:22:04.700
Jay Lao: so not so so far one week into the project. I think she's very proactive. If I if I push her a little bit, she can deliver even go extra miles over the we can

121
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.059
Jay Lao: So so far, so good.

122
00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:12.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you.

123
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:45.339
Jacky Lai: I've been stuck on the on long case for on bank of Betty and Her performances were consistent, and I'll check with Zina Natalie and for India. I think she's very strong in research, in analysis, and also he's very active in in the in for modules along the way, and also she has very good communication with the client. So over a license, it's a well on track so nothing back to say. But it's it's overall. It's

124
00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:51.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thank you. Next one.

125
00:22:51.360 --> 00:23:10.939
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. It's been loaded in March. in So that she's got overall. But it's a popular feedback from her and find management and alsoification with some thanks for putting through alongside the.

126
00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:39.450
SHI.42.South.06: So the availability looks a little bit well, because previously it was she was all Pd. With play that, and also with the a bit of successfully converted and felt by now she's just being staffed on to a new case. So availability of kind proofing the next cycle and she's also all over of of her needs to availability and weaker and also plungeability. So I wouldn't think she has that much of a problem.

127
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:41.930
SHI.42.South.06: Okay.

128
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.020
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thank you.

129
00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:51.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Cool. Next one.

130
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.309
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: William John, 10 me

131
00:23:54.610 --> 00:24:14.349
Tammy Tan: William is a very strong associate. he was promoted to say, in 24 months he is still early, but I say 10 years, 3 months but consistent good feedback skills that are very well around that, and also strong commitment and the ownership

132
00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:33.309
Tammy Tan: the only thing I can notice like she she he is definitely a very core member of the Ig PA, he worked with a lot of auto and it cases. I I just don't want to encourage him to work with more more pas, but overall very well, very strong kind of day.

133
00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:38.490
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright, thank you. Next one

134
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:39.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she called.

135
00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.970
Zhigang Shi: Yeah, I'm just gonna promote to essay

136
00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:53.989
Zhigang Shi: she, I think I would say she has a very strong affiliation with the ib, i a AI account

137
00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:59.869
Zhigang Shi: you. Obviously the problem is still availability. Right? So in the I'll chat with her in the past 2

138
00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:05.260
Zhigang Shi: mosses. She is constantly on the I. I. Pd. Work.

139
00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:17.490
Zhigang Shi: and I made it clear to her that she need to work out for her ability, credibility, and she, and a diverse it by herself.  in terms of the PA types of account. So

140
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.259
Zhigang Shi: yeah, I I that one of the

141
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.960
Zhigang Shi: is she aware of her ability.

142
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:34.299
Zhigang Shi: She do. She is sort of aware of, but not. I don't think she's she got the clear message and strong message. I will bring it back to her again. during the post.

143
00:25:35.330 --> 00:26:02.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, for for this one to go Actually, Natalie mentioned this in a Cdc. Yesterday, but she just left for another meeting style. Speak of her even for Pvp. As now we're in seeing them to be more comfortable, not to affiliate only with one and an Mdp. Or account. So for, as I say, I, it's really hard to see the future potential. If she's

144
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.980
Zhigang Shi: so a strong message to that

145
00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.709
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: right moving to next one.

146
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: sherry, John Jeffrey.

147
00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and Jeffrey is not with us. Then, moving to Eve, Ma Jackie

148
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:54.009
Jacky Lai: for you on my, I play you on to Olande, who seems to last at say, and when she came back from the one location actually, she is not able to find out good case for him for her. So all her availability is is my high is is a little bit low and he supports a lot of Bd. And during the last 2 or 3 months I also check with the pls the who he supports.

149
00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:03.859
Jacky Lai: I think the overall. The work quality is good, and it has done good job. You know. Bd process. So we're all I think it's it's it's on track.

150
00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:12.289
Zhigang Shi: It is a. So she, if also worked with me for one week.

151
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.360
Zhigang Shi: the, I would say, the

152
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:39.149
Zhigang Shi: the experience is not so good. so here's the so on the first day or Monday morning. she messaging me and say that staffing said he, will support me for 4 days, and on the foundation as to me and say, Sorry I have annually, and it has to use Otherwise, otherwise it will be it. It will expire so I can only support it 3 days, I think that's something right. And on the

153
00:27:39.440 --> 00:28:00.740
Zhigang Shi: on the third day, certain day So on the second, at the end of second day she send me the message again so, and say that. Sorry to go so I'm just calculating my annually. But again in a. Because after annually there, she also had l way. so I cannot support you on the survey. so

154
00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:12.490
Zhigang Shi: I was a bit, you know, a pistol because she didn't even ask like, do you have a do due date with client should I, you know? Give the 5 alternatives?

155
00:28:12.490 --> 00:28:28.270
Zhigang Shi: she that you ask, and the messages to me just I have messed up with my and it leave, and I have to leave And so that's the message to me, right? So I don't think. And and I feel like the people are very I would say, oh.

156
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:34.770
Zhigang Shi: it can be. That's kind of selfish right? So you always think about the benefits, how to maximize her benefits, not even thinking about

157
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:58.120
Zhigang Shi: our commitment to client, and and not even thinking about what? How do you communicate with the client? Right? So a. And on the Bd, I I I think that and that, and it. The way, I reply to her is that there's there should be an official process right? If you ask for 1 one more day that there should be somebody approve you and and and and I think that's something

158
00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:14.329
Zhigang Shi: I feel that is not so good. And that's still the mindset that I think a lot, not just her per individual, but I lost all the ancestors on the one side that they only trying to put on good in the in the casework, and and they

159
00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:24.320
Zhigang Shi: they don't, they don't, you know. See the, the, the, the effort they have to pay, especially their work. I'll set up their own PA on Bd work. They don't feel like they have the application

160
00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.950
Zhigang Shi: to work hard. Yeah.

161
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:48.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And yeah, I I want to echo to down that I I think if it's me in terms of the professionalism, I think she needs really had some room to improve. not only because of not only just this this one single time, but she, I think she has been

162
00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.370
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: really

163
00:29:50.450 --> 00:30:05.469
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: having some issues about asking for leaves not not giving us already. Notice. That's one thing. The second thing is that she has been really picky on on case stopping. I think she she's

164
00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:08.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I I don't think she is putting

165
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:37.389
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the firm, or the clients benefits in in her mind. She's basically calculating her own interest of her own benefits in terms of making decisions to be staff or not. So so that's I I yeah, that's a she really needs to improve in that regard.

166
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:50.330
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, thank you. I I also got heard some of the complaint on the So during the staffing.

167
00:30:50.470 --> 00:31:01.090
SHI.42.South.06: it's not just like area to in for improvement. It's a second. It can the active issue super picky about the not just the case. But also.

168
00:31:01.150 --> 00:31:19.700
SHI.42.South.06: okay. So one of this like a multiple cases refused. And then always, that's excuse of saying I'm waiting for what one case, and then later on on some other cases. And then she agrees at that. Later it started to pick out more juice

169
00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:45.779
SHI.42.South.06: and then saying, some healthy issues that so and then only willing to do the work. But during the Bd work you, we we're heard of like a trigon plane, and also there's an a as a like a shall have complain now that we work with support as well. So this is not just like a little bit of that. This is this is this.

170
00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:51.649
SHI.42.South.06: I feel this sounds like it. It's not a serious. And it you issue.

171
00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:56.520
Jay Lao: Yeah, this is Jay. I I want to add that

172
00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:09.990
Jay Lao: actually, I I'm I'm surprised by the comments made by. If it doesn't sound like the if I I knew a couple of years ago. I I'm not trying to challenge that. I think fax is fact. Probably she does have a

173
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.690
Jay Lao: added to you, and towards vd.

174
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:26.420
Jay Lao: I think we should definitely give her this message again, not trying to make excuse. But I want to remind that she's also heading all the so social committee clubs in Shanghai.

175
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:32.889
Jay Lao: probably she's spending a lot of time there. I I know for a fact that she spends a huge amount of time

176
00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:51.689
Jay Lao: organizing events. for for my office in in different clubs, I mean, we have, we? I I just want to give you guys a full picture if if she has, I need to issue towards it in other areas we should give him, and she'll give her a message. But she's also like spending her. She's not.

177
00:32:51.800 --> 00:33:01.260
Jay Lao: She's not like spending her time on her own. She's spending a lot of time on the on the clubs. So probably also an adjustment in that. But I just want to give you the full picture.

178
00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.479
Zhigang Shi: Yeah. But this comes to you in the order. Right? So what's the power it's for?

179
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.719
Jay Lao: Yes, of course, I totally agree.

180
00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.360
Jacky Lai: Yes.

181
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:33.509
SHI.42.South.06: been to her power and the usual, but I don't think she's selfish or calculating if we look at you know her component of part, but also on the modules I'm very collaborative to have as a team members in the project. So I I I think it's less all we love

182
00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:56.130
SHI.42.South.06: self focus. But it's more on how the priority and the improvement they commitment, of course. But what you're talking about is the one why, she was the 8 right? So what we're talking about, is she? She? She was promoted as A. We recently thought CC. Shows. I heard it as frequently from like

183
00:33:56.130 --> 00:34:05.790
SHI.42.South.06: sobbing. And also well, you know, it's also connected right. So the cost of, as I mentioned about case first, and then there's more to.

184
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:11.159
SHI.42.South.06: So it's it's so. There's you always like a

185
00:34:11.429 --> 00:34:25.200
SHI.42.South.06: I have some meaningful reasons. But if it is a serious and a case, and then even to the audio level, and it's really about some something I'll I'll be. There's a Pdp out there. There's something wrong with them.

186
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:33.060
SHI.42.South.06: and maybe because after the PA of the estate, promoting a few, some change, I think, for a social

187
00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:50.249
SHI.42.South.06: impact the social this, all is a contribution, which is certainly, but everything like a particularly in such business situation. Right? So so and a stuff on case to support. That is really number one.

188
00:34:51.830 --> 00:35:15.310
Jacky Lai: Yes, regarding just a Michael mentioned you is key for case definitely. I also discussed with the to this to you. he start picking case For example, when she came back from the location, in some cases approximately her and one time. I think she's ready to have some of the issue before he gets a health check report. He has to have some discussing with the Pl. And of from this tools

189
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:34.590
Jacky Lai: to to work on the case. But I think that after the first day he called the health check reports, we ready has some to health issues. So he wants to to, to, to, to get this to to more health check, to to make sure he is in the right state of work or her health. So I think it's he's not taking the case.

190
00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:56.990
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, thank you, Jackie. But the thing is that she has already taken like one month away, and she came back, and I am oh, I was just checking all her like a vacation record. I mean, there's there there are like a long list of vacations she has asked and she has taken. And so when she came back from a long vacation.

191
00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:15.690
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We assume that you have recovered from the the the your, your, your, your health issue right? And and then her. Her health issue is not something very act like, it's not a cute disease. It's more like some kind of

192
00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:22.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: kind of kind of So if you really have a

193
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:49.040
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: imminent health issues you should keep, take, take a longer vacation, but which we will definitely support, and if you choose to come back to work, then we? We assume that you are 100. You can be 100% dedicated to your work right? And and her attitude on Vd works, as Jagon said, I mean I I as other. Some other Pr's complaint about was totally unprofessional

194
00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:54.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and continue to to pick up on cases. It's again unprofessional.

195
00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I mean assuming that you you are fully recovered.

196
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:02.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Right?

197
00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:13.999
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That's not I. I don't think that's an excuse to to to to adopt the unprofessional behavior just because of some kind of long term.

198
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:17.450
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm sorry.

199
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:39.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah to to echo Michael. we. We are not saying that. if they have, how concerned they shouldn't be considered. But we are saying that if they don't have any health concern they could definitely take our work if we're right. And because I I think it's a commitment issue. if you are

200
00:37:39.830 --> 00:38:07.139
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: being peaking for 2 or 3 CPU cases, you into the module level and also complain that Bd, that's definitely attitude issue. I don't see it to be any. And and that's also calculating right that the just to to reply to some previous comments. I mean I I know that she could be like work. She could work very hard when she was an associate, but by right, just right. After she got promoted and she decided to

201
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:13.079
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to become a to adopt a totally different work attitude. That's that's calculating.

202
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:14.010
Okay?

203
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:18.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Using this.

204
00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:41.469
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also with very sufficient CPU case experience. Honestly, it is super busy in the first half and we have all cp, C's, and those that working closely with cps, they have very high availability. But here, looking at the hardware ability that definitely shows an issue

205
00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:44.169
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: after promotion to

206
00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:51.869
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 5 5 months. how many? 2 months? I still no, no, no case at all.

207
00:38:51.880 --> 00:39:04.389
Lin An: I yeah, I think that's just really strange. Because I actually, I was trying to staff people, for like a few cases in in the first half of this year, but I never know if my is available.

208
00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:11.080
Lin An: I didn't know she had.

209
00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:19.319
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: He? She did take her L a. earlier. That's probably the reason. But for you herself

210
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:32.919
SHI.42.South.06: that's actually you should be should be one. So she was for very long since. I think there are multiple times of trying to step, but number is off her name on the

211
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:37.360
Lin An: unavailable leave. Otherwise I will that far.

212
00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:49.960
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, as Michael mentioned, she's taking 1 h a and a very fragmented tick list. And also the that. That's probably the reason I you. I was missed.

213
00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:52.280
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, yeah.

214
00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.740
Lin An: again.

215
00:39:54.490 --> 00:40:11.669
Jay Lao: yeah. I I think. the issue is very clear. I will rather put it a priority issue than out it to issue attitude issue. I think we need to think, I think our way to to talk to her on this. because her performance is okay. if it's just

216
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:32.240
Jay Lao: how she prioritized for time, that's not, or even, it's really her health issue. I think we we need to find out reason, because I I just find it really surprised to see a person change dramatically. So after promotion. maybe if if she's calculating and we are not going to tolerate that we should not let her know.

217
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:46.209
Jay Lao: but but I I I was I would stop her definitely for her performance. I I just don't understand why she is showing this kind of attitude. I I think we need to find out so. Yes, sorry. If that is the case.

218
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.450
Kay Tang: Does it make sense to Lee? In this case

219
00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:56.010
Kay Tang: email walked very hard on the cases, and then

220
00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.319
Kay Tang: she pays no attention to the Bds. I think the the situation. Same here

221
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:14.619
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: even email is even a little bit better, because she's not kicking on Case. She's only doing that on Bds right? And if it's both Bd and picking on kids, I think if we are benchmarking a calibre together, that's a rough. That

222
00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:17.659
Kay Tang: then shall we say email is also a priority issue.

223
00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:19.470
Kay Tang: Then we made a round position.

224
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:28.989
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: J. I think I I got your points. But a strong performer on case doesn't mean that this this person value is

225
00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:33.280
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: as it's along with us right now. It's actually.

226
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:43.239
Jay Lao: I mean what what the name the issue is. It's it's I don't think it's that important. I just think that if we talk to her and say, Hey, there's a problem you're too picky.

227
00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:50.139
Jay Lao: and she can change right now. That's that's my confidence in her. I just don't understand why she is doing this.

228
00:41:50.370 --> 00:42:04.940
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I I I understand your concerns. Shall we maybe put her on a ref like a 2 year message to her. Then if she's really changing back, then there's no issue anymore. Right

229
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:12.120
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But if if there's no clear word. I'm not sure if we could understand the reason behind.

230
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:36.150
Jacky Lai: And actually for her, added to the issue, I actually this is the first time of her card. She has samples add to the issue in the program at least a cycles. I never heard of this, so I think I I seem to reflect it. Maybe it's too harsh for her. we do figure out because she she just come back from the long beach and suddenly change the attitude. So I think we still need to give her. I upgrade. We need to give her a warning.

231
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:47.740
Jacky Lai: But I, since the reflect is to to has. he's considering he has very strong performer, and also he's a a very strong commitment.

232
00:42:49.180 --> 00:43:01.080
Jay Lao: I second that I I would do, for I would go for a warning, and then really try to talk to her, even even not just her advisor. But maybe maybe some of our previous Pr. Can talk to her to help her.

233
00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:05.510
Jay Lao: Then then I think it's not fair to email them.

234
00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:12.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I agree. with email, why is she a reflex? But you should. It's a warning.

235
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:26.920
SHI.42.South.06: But I think, for email, part partial reason for the rough one is also for her to to help her find cases for staffing like her availability.

236
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:37.900
SHI.42.South.06: She's stopable. Actually, your Cp. Is busy. The reason her availability is so low is she being picky about

237
00:43:37.910 --> 00:44:01.079
SHI.42.South.06: cases? And I always say I'm waiting for this. I'm waiting for that, and then one she and then Ronnie to spend the like hours of talking with her. Stop that, and she agreed on certain cases, and then later, she submitted to pick modules and say, Oh, that's more you I'm not going to. I'll be on it. And then again, like, yeah. So that's the that's the route.

238
00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.960
Jacky Lai: Yes.

239
00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.020
SHI.42.South.06: no.

240
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:15.919
SHI.42.South.06: yeah. All this, as we mentioned the last strategy in the cohort or the attitude of both Bd. And performance, and

241
00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:40.019
SHI.42.South.06: like what's we heard about it shows all this will be reflected in the overall view. So whether I think it is definitely a warning whether it's a red blanket warning or what child, what it need to be. Seriously it needs to, you know. Take a serious, I think we can take it serious, but just give us such a contrast

242
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:47.199
SHI.42.South.06: of you know how she performs in a and then, as I say, or whether we give you know what?

243
00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:54.140
SHI.42.South.06: It's a very severe signal. a a big yeah.

244
00:44:54.770 --> 00:45:14.640
Jacky Lai: Yeah. Actually, I think yesterday, I when I heard some, some, some, some some comments about this pt. Of from Clark. case. I have talked to her yesterday afternoon. Actually she's aware of the the comments, and that she has already, and very important to you. Attitude to to to change herself especially when in the future, when when

245
00:45:14.970 --> 00:45:19.049
Jacky Lai: so I think she's she's, you know. I'm saying you to be honest.

246
00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:20.880
Yeah.

247
00:45:22.090 --> 00:45:24.530
Jacky Lai: Jason, we should keep her sound sounds.

248
00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:33.049
Kay Tang: I think, is, that is, that does that should happen after the ref lack. I mean, we give her a chance. It's not a it decision.

249
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.620
Jacky Lai: Hi.

250
00:45:35.680 --> 00:46:00.069
Jacky Lai: and yeah, I talked to her yesterday afternoon. Actually I I I told her, as there is some comments about the her piki she's speaking about cases, you know. she's been aware of it before. On this day, when I talk to her she will see her. We're aware of this. All this comments and things. Also. She's ready to mix change. She's very positive to take those comments and embed his comments into her future attitude.

251
00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:10.180
Kay Tang: Well, I think whatever decision we're making, we need to be fair to everyone. If I if there's a DC of email, talk to email, right? Right? The one day before the Adc.

252
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:12.470
Kay Tang: Shall we change the decision? I don't think. So?

253
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:14.059
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I agree.

254
00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:35.250
SHI.42.South.06: Okay? And also, Jake, you probably haven't talked with other like a Pr who she has worked with. Vds, yeah. So as mentioned, it's not. It's not single complaint. It's multiple people.

255
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:40.029
Jacky Lai: Yes, yes, sure. Sure.

256
00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:42.880
SHI.42.South.06: Okay.

257
00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.990
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So so

258
00:46:45.210 --> 00:46:48.959
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so we conclude, what's our decision? Eventually.

259
00:46:53.320 --> 00:47:01.399
SHI.42.South.06: do we put both on what chart list or are we talking about? If they make it equal with it, both on what top?

260
00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.679
SHI.42.South.06: I'll put in a

261
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:20.989
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, because last time when we are talking about attitude issue is something that we want to highlight right now in the at court

262
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:43.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that we like. What? Let me just said, we see a tenancy. The aces are taking advantages of these things and being peaky on cases on Bds attitude issue. We've heard a lot today. And we're if we're not saying of these issues should be red black. I I'm not sure what we're actually promoting.

263
00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:57.360
SHI.42.South.06: It's a compounding case with the manufacturers. Right?

264
00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:14.989
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. So so so I I think whether if people are just realize they're this is an act to the issues will be approved whether we inform immediately as address Cl. without any further consideration, all we know that you know.

265
00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:24.340
SHI.42.South.06: potential to change previous performance capabilities.

266
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:30.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I I understand what should be the saying but for email last time

267
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:41.209
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's the first time we mentioned that issue as well, and we would put her on that side directly. and the reason we put on a refle is is because not a single plane, but multiple complaints.

268
00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:49.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I I don't see a difference from this case, though it is the first time we mentioned that in ABC. But it's a multiple campaign.

269
00:48:52.010 --> 00:49:02.709
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So let me ask a question like this, do you often see a. A. Or S. A. Who are well performed with good acting complaint by multiple Ppls.

270
00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:05.510
Yes.

271
00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:15.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and and for for this decision I think it's really easy to remove.

272
00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:23.620
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and if she she continued to be getting stopped, and not being complained for one or 2 s, she she got up right.

273
00:49:23.970 --> 00:49:26.839
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That's the that's where we see the improvement.

274
00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:38.700
SHI.42.South.06: Someone who here, others you in this committee. whether it's the we should give it a rough that

275
00:49:39.100 --> 00:50:06.869
SHI.42.South.06: I agree with the red flag you don't really still have that. We should give her a strong signal to. Yeah. I agree that if if that's an attitude issue, we and we we want to. send a message. We should send a message strong and the early before she promotes to consultant and it, and she comes. She goes to clients and clients, says something like we heard today. Then that's really a bigger issue. And

276
00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:15.409
SHI.42.South.06: if that if she is a potential consolid, and we should fix that as to issue as soon as possible. That's fine.

277
00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:36.299
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: One more I can to to this girl. I I I'm just wondering. if that does she still have have how she's or it is we're we're, I'm sure she she didn't mention it. It is good health issue. Let's ask her to take leave them.

278
00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:45.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, we're open to leaves. Right? If she really has.

279
00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.540
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

280
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:52.890
SHI.42.South.06: Okay.

281
00:50:54.950 --> 00:51:00.439
SHI.42.South.06: so this she just needs further investigation, or what on the.

282
00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:03.190
SHI.42.South.06: So what?

283
00:51:03.620 --> 00:51:09.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I didn't. we didn't receive anything from her anymore on council issue.

284
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:17.549
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I I think from our yeah working environment. If you didn't mention, we suppose that you are 100%

285
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: capacity. Right?

286
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:21.760
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

287
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:34.350
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, that's the case from what I heard of Shanghai. So that the meeting room I heard that like, people agree with. roughly.

288
00:51:35.610 --> 00:51:37.580
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: yeah.

289
00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:48.890
Jay Lao: I I I respect the position. First of all, I I don't really know. Reflex or watch list. Well, if if she got off next cycle, what are the difference between

290
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:51.760
Jay Lao: giving him a ref now, or I watch this now.

291
00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:56.600
Jay Lao: I I I may be not familiar with the difference here. secondly, I think

292
00:51:56.650 --> 00:52:06.870
Jay Lao: she just promoted a couple of months ago and then didn't get a case in this in this past 2 months, because the business is slow. And then suddenly, she's website.

293
00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:16.999
Jay Lao: I think we need to do a good job in communicating to her the seriousness of her issue. Otherwise, it looks really strange to me. I think.

294
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:39.689
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, I think, yeah, it's yeah. I think the communication how to communicate this. I think a later, you know, work with the pitchy and the daddy and offline. yeah, I think it's a clear message in terms of the difference you asked about

295
00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:47.490
SHI.42.South.06: red, red, black at the watch out? as I understood it, one reflex an official one.

296
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:53.260
SHI.42.South.06: It's a stronger right then. What charge?

297
00:52:53.630 --> 00:52:57.019
SHI.42.South.06: That's it. Yeah. Sometimes I like what child

298
00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:05.909
SHI.42.South.06: some of the Cdas one communicating it. It's not that strong. So that's could be the that's

299
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:15.419
SHI.42.South.06: concerning that, and probably a strong message as well as a strong message. I think we need to put it in our official

300
00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:27.609
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  other objections as moved to

301
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:32.280
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and see what any.

302
00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:52.550
Shelley Liu: The I only see one data points here, but when I talk to the that, she actually worked on 2 projects during the last cycle, and the 2 to be us both gave her a strong, too. So she's like, just like hiding. she is a consistently strong performer.

303
00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.390
SHI.42.South.06: Okay. as a go to this

304
00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:59.960
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for me.

305
00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:10.740
Richard Guo: for me, it's it's doing okay? She just got promotion for 2 months, and the first case got it to some track

306
00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:17.199
Richard Guo: I think she will get her and 2 year Nba program in from this summer.

307
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:21.969
Richard Guo: So I I don't think we we need to spend more time about her.

308
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:26.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, nice just to check this Travis back.

309
00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:29.010
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. Yeah.

310
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:31.779
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: do you want to talk about

311
00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:57.839
SHI.42.South.06: when he he is on track she is very stable. And recently, she's working on the headway case and the feedback from the Pl. E, and it's very positive regarding the problem, solving client traction, etc., etc. Just can we see the sub scores They could have told me that she gave the wrong score for the subscribers.

312
00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:01.090
SHI.42.South.06: Oh, we cannot

313
00:55:03.770 --> 00:55:04.690
SHI.42.South.06: job.

314
00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:06.760
SHI.42.South.06: The

315
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:21.339
SHI.42.South.06: oh, yes, regarding the Ford score for the room model, because that it's a

316
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:33.649
SHI.42.South.06: it's a it's a mistake. she she thought. That home is a it's a good one. So I check with her. It's good for her. For when you no problem at this sub dimension.

317
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:38.650
SHI.42.South.06: so yeah, overall no issues.

318
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.760
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If you tell us it's too young back.

319
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:50.070
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, and then

320
00:55:56.210 --> 00:56:03.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: not then.

321
00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:16.980
Jacky Lai: Yes, for Fiji. I think her performance is very consistent. And and it seems to us in the last 3 months he

322
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:39.309
Jacky Lai: he was working on all transfer operations from based in case he's in Marlow and the Malad people are very positive feedback. you especially. He has raised a good communication with a client, even even including sound foreign senior clients, and also he has, very strong promo sovi scales, and a very effective, efficient delivery.

323
00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:56.859
Jacky Lai: So the kind of faith that you see is very, very good, and also he has very strong client performance, and the printing is he's not good, so it's a he's. He's he's very good. So we're also a performance. He's strong, so I think we can promote her in 15 months, maybe. Yeah.

324
00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:08.160
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  let me show my screen. This is

325
00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:27.329
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: She looks very similar to the download.

326
00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:28.460
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

327
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:38.130
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  it's it's it's it's

328
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:47.930
one.

329
00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:51.109
SHI.42.South.06: We. I'll

330
00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:55.159
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. I guess if

331
00:57:55.270 --> 00:58:01.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we should put part to next level to see if it's 18 month.

332
00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:05.600
Jacky Lai: Oh, okay.

333
00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.149
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yes. A lady would be that the like. You know that always.

334
00:58:10.310 --> 00:58:13.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's relatively lower than good use.

335
00:58:13.450 --> 00:58:23.789
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If you are checking with with this members, you should

336
00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:24.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 1, 3.

337
00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.510
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And so

338
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:31.099
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she my.

339
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:35.660
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah.

340
00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:43.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright. So I think that's pretty much for essay. And we still have 2

341
00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:47.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: people from

342
00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:55.009
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  it looks very on track. So maybe let's get that those 2 into the Ca back.

343
00:58:55.140 --> 00:59:07.429
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And since that, shall we take a 2 min break. And also because you want to a little bit and get back, maybe get 55. Yeah.

344
00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:10.610
SHI.42.South.06: yes, that's not like that's take a

345
00:59:10.990 --> 00:59:13.820
SHI.42.South.06: like a few minutes. Right?

346
00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:15.120
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay.

347
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:48.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay.

348
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:22.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you.

349
01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:46.189
SHI.42.South.06: Also in cash about. They think maybe I should go home. Now let's reside.

350
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.350
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, no, you not

351
01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:28.579
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright. let's move to associate. So, starting from 8 to from open discussion, first one is John way, Alex.

352
01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:41.809
TAI.Yuguang Island: hi so in the last cycle we propose that 33 in a month promotion to senior associate some way can sustain the performance keep this up.

353
01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:55.269
Then, in the recent cycle. She has a consistent performance, got a one from the recent project. also maintain high availability. So basically, I should take all boxes.

354
01:07:55.600 --> 01:08:06.249
And since she has consistently received great feedback, and also prevent that. she is very functional across the different PA,

355
01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:20.790
and we will like to propose a 15 month promotion. and if we get into the specifics on top of her apartment solving skill.

356
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:28.960
TAI.Yuguang Island: she would make a breakthrough in client engagement. So in the recent case she was not only able to

357
01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:40.280
to lead stakeholders in completing tasks. There also are creating impacts in transferring some of the core, consulting sc to to client a working team.

358
01:08:40.330 --> 01:08:43.379
so thereby enhancing credibility of Pcg.

359
01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:47.630
TAI.Yuguang Island: so it has to the the proposal.

360
01:08:49.029 --> 01:08:55.709
So I'll lead that to the I'll bring this discussion to A and see if that that can be approved.

361
01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes.

362
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:07.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so shall we look at the television page?

363
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:25.529
Tammy Tan: The way is the working on my case. I just want to quickly add, I think, she can. It's of the 33 months promotion, which is already very late. it's a implementation type of case I want to highlight. She's kind of like a very straight, some smart girl.

364
01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:51.589
Tammy Tan: I can't observe her really behave very smartly in many, in managing clients stakeholders, which, as she sometimes she can be very aggressive. What you even in front of getting the the getting what she wants with the different when there's vendors. very objective of a rented getting things down and set. I I really appreciate that.

365
01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:54.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you, Tony.

366
01:09:55.580 --> 01:10:00.779
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  So, looking at the calibration page.

367
01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:12.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think, for hours, and also the what it average. I'll fall into the ranch right?

368
01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:17.690
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And also with some recent

369
01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.650
SHI.42.South.06: second off.

370
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:27.589
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I guess that's a 33 month emotion this year. Also a decision, right? Any object? This?

371
01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:43.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: No, it's no objection we'll put 33 months for and moving to next one. Then you do you

372
01:10:45.290 --> 01:11:01.109
SHI.42.South.06: so semi? As actually she showed a very good trajectory. she's already in 32 months, as a previously actually on sale the

373
01:11:01.410 --> 01:11:29.529
SHI.42.South.06: but our performance I've checked with the pls they're imaging with as well as previous performance with to I care hospitals as well as her recurrence and Cp part in a real estate consist. Today we see very good feedback on our ownership of driving modules

374
01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:49.949
SHI.42.South.06: improved structuring problem, solving skills very good at communication, especially communication with content. so I think we should definitely encourage you to purchase, as you know, improvement after being

375
01:11:50.150 --> 01:12:17.450
SHI.42.South.06: good trajectory to be on on to open for for discussion whether we want to move her from the and then to be on this cycle, I'll wait for availability to be continuously. I want to have like that under this business environment, I think on roughly to and

376
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:25.500
SHI.42.South.06: positive feedback. it's not easy. of any. But the the way today

377
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:33.020
SHI.42.South.06: it's too low.

378
01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:36.009
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

379
01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.390
SHI.42.South.06: reasons of scores are good

380
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:47.630
SHI.42.South.06: question. So if the recent sub scores are all one, why the overload is 2, because the color regime

381
01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.550
SHI.42.South.06: okay?

382
01:12:52.270 --> 01:12:59.450
SHI.42.South.06: And because with ours, yeah, if you look at the in that

383
01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:03.549
SHI.42.South.06: all the yeah. When?

384
01:13:06.940 --> 01:13:29.070
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Well, I I'll have to clarify that. we won't be saying due to collaboration. This conversion is actually making everyone comparable. Right? But the this definitely shows that you you're

385
01:13:29.090 --> 01:13:41.449
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all once. Would that be reasonable? But I think for Denny's case. It's more about this improvement. but if she's ready for I I say it's not. Maybe we should consider the copyright tenure

386
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.690
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to give her longer. Anyway.

387
01:14:00.890 --> 01:14:05.109
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think the problem is, she's still not finishing the scp right?

388
01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:07.540
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So

389
01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:26.020
SHI.42.South.06: she she's already on the last day of project to know. We all finished scp in just a few weeks, so we can. Yes, and I've heard from the

390
01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:27.510
SHI.42.South.06: 2 2

391
01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:30.169
SHI.42.South.06:  to finish the test.

392
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:39.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So what's how many he's you would? That sounds like a

393
01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:45.689
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: profile or would then need more time to practice.

394
01:14:46.610 --> 01:15:03.339
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, if I Cp at all fields with the current score. that may be this from from workshops. But why do we promote her in this cycle? Or we actually take another action of for now we've got 10

395
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:06.149
SHI.42.South.06: that's right. It just transferred.

396
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:37.989
SHI.42.South.06: So it will be like they shall. We consider to adjust the 10 so to for the benefit to if we think our implement is not sufficient for promotion. But then then I suggest that we

397
01:15:39.280 --> 01:16:03.969
SHI.42.South.06: We'll get back maybe 6 months or so. That sounds sounds reasonable because trajectory looking at some scores as are actually upward. I so still have a a potential. So I'll say so, probably long runway, and then cut a 10. You probably should be the best way. Yeah.

398
01:16:04.450 --> 01:16:15.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, a great. It's actually given current case. It's not sport yet. It's just not getting. The 2 of them. Ncp is not finished. So that's maybe give her a longer.

399
01:16:20.690 --> 01:16:29.949
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And also it's a natural fire with 23 months, Mr. Firm only has.

400
01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:34.540
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's not bottom 20. But I guess it's is

401
01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:40.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  yeah. Button.

402
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:49.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. Shall we look to the next one? Call me up, Charlie?

403
01:16:53.580 --> 01:17:20.839
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Yup, but for out sure So yao is now 32 months. But but remember, he similar to Danny, got 12 months tenure when he came, I think generally upward trajectory. over the last few months. he! He's been going to the consistent threes to consistent to and definitely

404
01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:30.319
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: strong strengths and then perhaps kind of seen effectiveness, teaming and role model, and and to an extent

405
01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:43.650
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: that being said, he's on a Dt at the moment, which is which is drawn of you. in the way that he reacts under pressure. so I think

406
01:17:43.790 --> 01:18:07.139
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: from his latest case, which he hasn't got an evaluation from which is very pressured. It seems like this? some sort of development areas. So in insight in terms of sort of polishing insights. A bit more more concise in in in a few questions. on his written slides being a bit more concise as well

407
01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:15.539
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: more precise to keep messages less worthy etc. And then from a press.

408
01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:31.249
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: even being more, you know, quicker to output. So I think all of these things have been okay on, on cases which should be not such high pressure, but this one's very time constrained. and service a have drawn some sort of.

409
01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:59.850
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: I don't want to say, but draws Mary's So I was before I before I heard that feedback. I wasn't suggesting push for his permission. So now it's 33 months but I think In. In contrast to that, I think I think we shouldn't promote it now but should maybe give him another 3 months to see off this TV whether he can prove himself. These areas

410
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:04.110
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: which he had been proving. before he

411
01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:20.430
SHI.42.South.06:  well.

412
01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:35.719
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: his his case availability, I think is is a bit low because he was invested some time. but he is generally on cases. so he is very.

413
01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:45.240
SHI.42.South.06: So you'll propose. okay, so you have the situation.

414
01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:56.690
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: I think we I I think we just retain him now. the only question is, do we need to reduce what happens at 36 months.

415
01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:03.519
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: It's 36 months, the very last decision that we can we can give.

416
01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:11.169
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, Charlie. Technically, we have to put him on that. It's not promoted right now and not

417
01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:15.450
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: okay. It

418
01:20:16.380 --> 01:20:19.090
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: is there any way that we can reduce this tenure that

419
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:33.640
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we could discuss that? I think maybe is better for him to to that some of the tenor, and I'll get more practice. And also that way he might not be clicking on that.

420
01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:38.960
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: He definitely needs more time.

421
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:50.160
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I think for this patch of in general, they're lacking of a case experiences. So maybe give them a bit long way. for that.

422
01:20:53.500 --> 01:21:04.199
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Yeah. So maybe we could take 6 months, 10 year off. And then you know, see how he performs in in a couple more cases.

423
01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:11.969
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, and we'll cut 6 months tenure

424
01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:14.839
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: next one

425
01:21:14.890 --> 01:21:21.849
Michelle Ma:  that's here

426
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:49.940
Michelle Ma: actually simmer was on red fact before and and we removed the that. And the recently she worked worked on 3 health care cases and continuously got to. So basically, I tried to feed back from the Japanese project leaders and and Vps say, first of all, I think Simon has a super good working at the and learning capability and can do that to

427
01:21:49.940 --> 01:22:14.780
Michelle Ma: so I think the Pvp. As they appreciate this kind of support and help. On the other hand, she was actually quite slow in the entire tenure. So the team, this is that as in mom was catching up and I heard that she is able to handle independent modules on the reason the case, I think that's a united. Imagine it.

428
01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:21.950
Michelle Ma:  so so that's basically the feedback I collect from has kept us, and

429
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:51.969
Michelle Ma: so I would say that Sima is depth, and I think she is slow from the beginning. On the other hand, she has she she she has continued, showing very good positive working attitude. And and the catching up, I would say so based on such feedback. And factors corrected, I think definitely, she is not a a a

430
01:22:52.060 --> 01:23:00.399
Michelle Ma: I call it. You know, the the A superstar basically to perform far, far away from. And she is also, you know.

431
01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:10.019
Michelle Ma: I think it's not a A is is a Ct case. So Based on this kind of consideration, I would say, maybe it's fair to

432
01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:32.430
Michelle Ma: give her a chance to be promoted at 36 months. So which is the longest at the Bcg. And, on the other hand, and she has not completed a Cp. So which means we, we cannot just decide her promotion. This cycle. and I know that technically, probably we need to give her another red effect. And so next cycle will be a decision up or out.

433
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:37.809
Michelle Ma: And the thing is to find a non has a case, and

434
01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:45.580
Michelle Ma: continue her performance, maybe basically a A, at least, if you need to get out to for another case.

435
01:23:46.670 --> 01:23:49.350
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And so the functionality issue.

436
01:23:49.610 --> 01:23:51.079
Michelle Ma: she has not solved them.

437
01:23:55.810 --> 01:23:59.400
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, I mean, plus.

438
01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:13.689
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, this one would be similar to the previous 2 cases that she needs longer time. I know it's not just that off from the red flag. If we are putting her up back to that for Upper out

439
01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:15.730
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: might be a little bit pressure for her.

440
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:45.559
Michelle Ma: I think. Yeah, I I I checked with her Mdp now, because she is working on. I think it's a long term case. my question is, are you willing to staff for for next next cycle? And offer her 100% availability. So the answer is, yes, so based on this feedback, on a confirmation, I would say she is staffable then. that's why I I would say I would support for the 6 months. promotion.

441
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:57.520
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, if that's the case, we we would put it in a ref that for now

442
01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.299
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then discuss my stuff.

443
01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:06.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because technically, you have to do that. Thank you.

444
01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:14.339
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. And then moving to next one Karina.

445
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:19.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so I'll tell you. You probably need to come here for a

446
01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:21.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yes.

447
01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:43.099
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so Karina has been. Karina is a lateral hire. So after she joined she actually, I we see, like very healthy growth trajectory. I actually indeed see receive like positive, positive, and improving performance for each of her case.

448
01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:58.650
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So now I I think the pivot, the recent feedback I collected from the the last 2 projects, both the P. Else thought that she was ready for essay promotion and her for herself. She is actually pretty proactive

449
01:25:58.650 --> 01:26:09.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to push for a 27 months promotion time window, and would like to learn the criteria if she couldn't get us like 27 months promotion.

450
01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:26.789
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's already 28. Right? Yeah, because I think last time we still think that she is, she's not ready for 27, but I think she's already have some like concern, or like some

451
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:35.480
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: like she, she would like to really learn about the the reason for the last city's decision. Right? Yeah.

452
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:43.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because she thinks that she has been improving very fast. And she thought she is already ready for as it

453
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:48.820
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So this I call she's working on

454
01:26:49.270 --> 01:27:05.759
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: One of the insurance is, the other is a business business transformation. And that's that would be in total 500 h. So last time our would be around

455
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:08.700
SHI.42.South.06: 1,200 right

456
01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:12.350
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: with 16 months with us.

457
01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:18.029
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  that seems a little bit and sufficient.

458
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:43.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Well, shall we maybe let this discuss because we we never make a retroactive promotion. So shall we discuss from 30 month promotion for now and then, maybe saying could help to check on the discussion we make last time

459
01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: how to answer

460
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:54.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that. Okay, sure, yeah. So for 30 months promotion?

461
01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.010
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  shall we look at the collaboration page?

462
01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:12.939
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, it's it's 30 months. Looks, actually, okay. Yeah. So it's really high.

463
01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:23.130
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  yeah. Well, so the only thing would be these sports

464
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:28.640
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the the 2 2. One is coming from Chelsea, or is it?

465
01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Why inflated?

466
01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:37.520
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That's the only thing. So I to make this decision?

467
01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:49.019
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I guess. So with the 2 scores. 30 months. Still, it's okay. Right? Yeah. I think you can calibrate that one to 2.

468
01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:55.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  the score will be 2.2 7,

469
01:28:55.210 --> 01:29:04.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and that's still in the yeah. So let's make a 30 month.

470
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:13.720
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. Moving to the next one we now as well as she present. So

471
01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:22.059
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, actually for it, she has,

472
01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:39.609
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for cost. Different projects receive positive feedback from Gpios, So and also from my side, because 2 weeks ago I got a team for our colleagues, and I sample I I sat for 4 and 5 days.

473
01:29:39.610 --> 01:29:57.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so she was pretty smart to catch up with the case content. And she it's a very career logic, when that's why. So I've been. she's quite a quick efficient, and has a very strong

474
01:29:57.270 --> 01:30:00.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and my observation

475
01:30:00.890 --> 01:30:06.560
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: is this aligned it? It's also align with all her.

476
01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:12.999
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: The only issue here occur is

477
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:20.279
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then we'll also within maybe a

478
01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:27.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  if it is 30 months.

479
01:30:27.610 --> 01:30:29.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Then we we shot

480
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:37.700
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: confirm that next next time. But currently, I think first I'll go. The problem is the

481
01:30:37.710 --> 01:30:46.299
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for the last month. Yeah. So let's just encourage her to improve that and check next. Next.

482
01:30:46.940 --> 01:30:47.820
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay?

483
01:30:48.020 --> 01:30:54.890
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So so her call for availability looks, okay. But how come the Yt availability is so low

484
01:30:55.940 --> 01:30:57.469
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: welcome to 10%.

485
01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:21.530
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I actually, I'm not quite sure why? Because a couple of home has been consistently. But it's just difficult to get her stuff that. But she's

486
01:31:22.730 --> 01:31:37.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. And also if I have the opportunity to. Very good associate. Okay. Gotcha. So just remind her on the.

487
01:31:37.460 --> 01:31:41.230
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So we don't need to decide right now, right

488
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:44.549
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: next one Shanghai. Natalie.

489
01:31:45.200 --> 01:32:06.679
Natalie Hua: Yeah, for Joel, with stuffed a popcase since lost the C. Itc. And she received very good feedback from tray e I checked with trey e Julius, continuously delivered good work in all Pbpl's case work.

490
01:32:06.710 --> 01:32:35.759
Natalie Hua: and she top 0 things the last last 3 projects. And if we look at her scores, her course is very good. And availability is quite high fully phone to all all her Ppo things she has 24 material. So I think she is ready for promotion. 27 month. Promotion

491
01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:53.070
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: down and pretty high availability, and also good good score. shall we confirm our 27

492
01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:07.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: next one, Tony Tom Jeffrey.

493
01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for free?

494
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:28.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right, let's move to next one. Feel my app. Oh, yeah.

495
01:33:28.670 --> 01:33:31.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And for

496
01:33:31.890 --> 01:33:45.309
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: he he has. also, I'm consistently with a very. And also we noticed that he got a one from a recent case.

497
01:33:45.390 --> 01:34:04.560
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  and yeah, and if you're Otpos best with me, I mentioned this which contributed a lot to his, his work. So and also getting back to his

498
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:10.760
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So it's it's what we would suggest. We have a

499
01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:22.139
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I feel it's a lateral right? Yeah.

500
01:34:22.570 --> 01:34:25.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 27, for that was pretty fast.

501
01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:31.270
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  So we check the case list

502
01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:41.010
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and he hasn't fulfilled the scp yet, right? Comparing to which we just discussed. Since that it's a one level down.

503
01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:42.820
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

504
01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:55.050
SHI.42.South.06: it's going to be the

505
01:34:56.690 --> 01:34:59.819
SHI.42.South.06:  It's good.

506
01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:16.219
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. I I think the phone is just not so full in the

507
01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.720
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the sop. Right?

508
01:35:21.790 --> 01:35:22.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Reason?

509
01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:24.130
Okay.

510
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:28.550
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, it's not about 27.

511
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:32.660
SHI.42.South.06: Let's wait. You next to all.

512
01:35:32.940 --> 01:35:33.800
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

513
01:35:36.150 --> 01:35:43.269
SHI.42.South.06: so far, doesn't need to cut tenure, either. So it's so, okay, trajectory. Actually. So.

514
01:35:43.680 --> 01:36:07.900
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, so the yeah, not yet as well. So one thing is the scp. The other thing is, if you look at the average scores. Yeah, and also availability. Comparing tuition salo, which which is confirmed to 27 right? Right? It seems that you is, not as good as much, you know. I'm post them that ability. Okay, okay, gotcha.

515
01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:17.249
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. And I'm not sure if he's currently on the case right now.

516
01:36:17.930 --> 01:36:22.150
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: probably the that one could help him.

517
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:26.539
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, it's still a

518
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:30.629
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: if he's not getting on another case. The

519
01:36:30.930 --> 01:36:36.170
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay. Yeah. So I think he's the only time. Okay, we've got it. Yeah.

520
01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:40.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. Moving to next one.

521
01:36:44.110 --> 01:36:57.940
Yue Hong Zhang: Hey? Sorry guys, I wasn't here. So I think I talked to a a recent PPI right? And she started as electoral higher, and has been doing a lot of cases in the and consistently

522
01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:10.010
Yue Hong Zhang: got positive feedback recently in order to solve our sensibility issue right? She shifted our focus to to 2 extra cases, one in the consumer space

523
01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.509
Yue Hong Zhang: place Charles one.

524
01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:23.910
Yue Hong Zhang: and they're the one in the public sector schools where is going on. And I think you know, both cases like that are strong performance, both in some of analytical skills, but also

525
01:37:24.250 --> 01:37:50.239
Yue Hong Zhang: in terms of right now, laying out essentially the right fact. having a fight based communication. the only Iraq for development is basically for the next level. I see progress being able to simplify a bit messaging right and be more like story planning oriented, especially for our Senior Level Communication. But overall, I think you know

526
01:37:50.380 --> 01:38:02.149
Yue Hong Zhang: she's been. She's been actually quite She received quite positive feedback across, and I believe that you know she has proven yourself outside of a has now called here.

527
01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.240
Yue Hong Zhang: So we are to be positive.

528
01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:14.170
Yue Hong Zhang: Now look, I think, in all that. I'm actually a bit surprised by the by, the I think that she she She's on the low end.

529
01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:18.460
Yue Hong Zhang: right? I think the port or what I mean. It's not too far from the average, but

530
01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:23.050
Yue Hong Zhang: slightly on the, on the, on the low end of that. But if you look at.

531
01:38:23.100 --> 01:38:26.599
Yue Hong Zhang: you know the track record right? For a lot of higher ways

532
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:38.940
Yue Hong Zhang: with some 10 years, I consistently, you know. to even across PA is it's something which is no, no defeats. So definitely, I would say, that's that's a positive

533
01:38:39.060 --> 01:38:42.190
Yue Hong Zhang: I'm on the

534
01:38:44.220 --> 01:39:12.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah you're home for the team actually one. What you to help out to remind her? because the peanuts on our flex month program, which means that she has 10 months capacity every year, and we'll rest to, not consecutively. that's fully fine as our program but I think that's available to you. Low is is for some reason before and after the leave

535
01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:22.170
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: you might be a little bit hard to find a case due to that one month to live, and then when I live to in in the

536
01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:36.219
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: second half of of the year. So I highly suggest to take that month the additional month leave later in this year so that she can get another get on another another case.

537
01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:42.820
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: What I now currently is she wants to take that in and off the join, which

538
01:39:42.850 --> 01:39:47.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for the cut the time.

539
01:39:47.780 --> 01:39:58.190
Yue Hong Zhang: So I mean looking looking looking at. It's close to the promotion, timeline, right? So I. You know, she's brought. Basically, like, you know, she's a straightforward profile, and I think she has solved

540
01:39:58.290 --> 01:40:06.490
Yue Hong Zhang: that's the way the Sdp should be. Yes, right. That's if she has all the credibility issues. It should be 2 case with one in public sector not only.

541
01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.900
Yue Hong Zhang: I mean in consumer.

542
01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:12.609
Yue Hong Zhang: Alright. And I said to not like the key question.

543
01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:32.409
Yue Hong Zhang: that basically. we need to to solve this, you know, like I, she's she's 26, right? you know, probably from a from from what I'm hearing, right? She's closer to a 27 type of profile, right? But also a happy to see her as it.

544
01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:47.819
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. And for scp, yeah, she's currently on a Ps case, but not yes board. So if she could get to our better score than it soft out. What else? I still need more time

545
01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:55.580
Yue Hong Zhang: actually got the tool on our previous. no, some similar one. This, Charles.

546
01:40:57.630 --> 01:40:59.700
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. But we need to. Right?

547
01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:06.670
Yue Hong Zhang: Okay? So the so I I just want to make sure I communicate clearly. So basically I should.

548
01:41:07.830 --> 01:41:19.829
Yue Hong Zhang: It's good that you've got the 2 on that case. But you need another 2 on in order to scale the I just want to know, like, what's the requirement? You see, the requirement in how to score it. The department the same hours.

549
01:41:20.170 --> 01:41:24.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. She need another 2 from current case.

550
01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:28.219
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: which is almost finished, but not yet for

551
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:34.980
Yue Hong Zhang: okay, so what does it mean now, are we trying to down

552
01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:37.230
Yue Hong Zhang: promotion timeline and then

553
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:41.209
Yue Hong Zhang: put it conditional to another tool others work on.

554
01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.400
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: He's not getting in a hours of 2 from?

555
01:41:49.650 --> 01:41:53.340
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: No, it's it's just

556
01:41:55.030 --> 01:42:00.400
Yue Hong Zhang: can you see how many hours that she that with them consumer contact?

557
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:08.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And you can put that out of that scp page and show your homeless.

558
01:42:19.470 --> 01:42:22.209
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Can we take a look at the scp page?

559
01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So as we

560
01:42:44.250 --> 01:42:59.980
Yue Hong Zhang: so is it taking? So I understand she's on. There is 2. There is 2 things right? So I think, to remember, we we discussed also that that case previously right? So what one thing, which is the new case that she got right. But last time I remember, we she did

561
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:21.450
Yue Hong Zhang: As for as any case for which actually it's a consumer topic and it's led by a consumer. And we I think we discussed last time that that would count as a also for selling as a as as a as a Cp, right? Because because of the availability of case, and then and an essentially different current.

562
01:43:21.770 --> 01:43:27.940
Yue Hong Zhang: So just wonder if that is already considering in this.

563
01:43:28.150 --> 01:43:57.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so yes, out your home. Remember our email chain. Last time we were saying, if that's sufficient time, we will consider it to be as if you finished. However, After after a while we will notice that this is only a at small I don't module with only I think it's 3 weeks which 2 less of the time. So I talked to Z. P. And she completely understand that that case is not content to be scp finished.

564
01:43:57.370 --> 01:44:02.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think that's why she's coming to the other case for Ps. Right now

565
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:06.930
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and after her, and case she's complete office.

566
01:44:07.130 --> 01:44:11.890
Yue Hong Zhang: But for the moment, for the second case, she's been also more than 3 weeks. 5.

567
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:20.459
Yue Hong Zhang: Yeah. So basically, like, you know, essentially, she, I mean, if I take 2, 40 h, it's 6 weeks. So the 2, the 2, 4, 40

568
01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:21.740
Yue Hong Zhang: should be finished.

569
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:23.720
Yue Hong Zhang: Yes.

570
01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:25.709
Yue Hong Zhang: basically. What we are saying is.

571
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:32.250
Yue Hong Zhang: can you look at this call of the second place to see if it's if it's also true, because if those

572
01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:38.070
Yue Hong Zhang: you know 2, 40 h and the score is is correct. And we we should be. We should be

573
01:44:44.410 --> 01:45:04.159
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so basically, if she gets another 2 from the current to Ps case, if she will, they? They will pass. She is past. Yeah, I I don't think that's much of the issue. Your home to be should be good. I think the more concern is only on availability. Like as we mentioned, we can promote

574
01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:09.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: those being bottom 20. So that's the major issue, not the scp.

575
01:45:11.050 --> 01:45:20.380
Yue Hong Zhang: Okay? And and basically essentially, what I'm saying is because she has 41 right? And if because I mean, I understand the hotel right? But

576
01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:25.009
Yue Hong Zhang: ultimately, I 41%. And how much is the average of the I

577
01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.230
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: cohort is 60

578
01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:39.219
Yue Hong Zhang: 50. So she has 9 points lower than than than than the cohort right? And basically those 9.6, if she's 25% right?

579
01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:45.069
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  oh, your horse, not my point. It's

580
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:50.070
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: her beloved is 30, something or 40, something. An average is 60,

581
01:45:51.700 --> 01:45:53.190
Yue Hong Zhang: 43, right?

582
01:45:53.850 --> 01:45:57.739
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. And but the average is 62,

583
01:45:58.130 --> 01:46:09.350
Yue Hong Zhang: 62. Okay, so it's 20 points of the I d. The difference between the she is currently in bottom 20 compared to all associate cohort.

584
01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:11.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And that's it forward.

585
01:46:12.850 --> 01:46:15.309
Yue Hong Zhang: So the

586
01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:17.470
SHI.42.South.06: it's a.

587
01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:21.410
SHI.42.South.06: it's 35%, right? So that's

588
01:46:22.530 --> 01:46:27.890
SHI.42.South.06: should be a client. Because I think we're looking really looking at what is

589
01:46:34.490 --> 01:46:46.140
SHI.42.South.06: I mean, cause didn't really see the issue. Anyway, it's not the 20. Still. Yeah, I like to leave our Sdp. But if it's if we're talking about availability that under my

590
01:46:46.300 --> 01:46:54.110
SHI.42.South.06: to be promoted to need 7 months. But then I think the

591
01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:58.049
SHI.42.South.06: you should be yeah, a bottleneck.

592
01:46:58.940 --> 01:47:27.499
Yue Hong Zhang: Yeah. So basically, the message should be then from a committee, right? If I hear everyone correctly, we should have a look. You know, you're doing a good job you're about to solve the safety issue. it's just a question of time, right? But essentially because of the plan delivery, which is one standard of aviation below the average right? 27 might be actually challenging. But you know, like, you just need to make sure your perspective of whatever you need that you pay

593
01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:35.969
Yue Hong Zhang: to basically meet to be closer to the average. for for the next window. Now, is it? Is it?

594
01:47:36.220 --> 01:47:43.449
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes, yes, and also your phone, please. I'll probably check zipping cumulative hours

595
01:47:43.610 --> 01:47:48.449
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: a thousand 300 where the the other 27 months.

596
01:47:48.570 --> 01:47:52.279
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: our 2,000 something. So she definitely need.

597
01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:55.690
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It may be 2 or 3 more cases to catch up.

598
01:47:55.860 --> 01:48:01.319
Yue Hong Zhang: No, but she's a electoral high. I think she came with Kenya. Right? So how do we take him back on that?

599
01:48:01.810 --> 01:48:07.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, that that definitely will be count. But as still, maybe one or more cases at least.

600
01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:08.980
Okay.

601
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:10.160
Yue Hong Zhang: great.

602
01:48:10.610 --> 01:48:15.140
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Okay. Moving to next one.

603
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:42.829
SHI.42.South.06: Okay. So you know, we need to discuss this case. to pay attention to this one. So I wanted to look at a performance capability, I think. she's on track okay. Availability good for evaluation grade improvement from, you know, a a few, 2, 3 to 2 consecutive ones.

604
01:48:42.830 --> 01:49:03.670
SHI.42.South.06: and I also heard from keel she's not she. She's yeah ownership, etc. But I think the key problem we're discussing here is not the performance. It's more on her integrity and model, because I heard that she also some issues

605
01:49:03.760 --> 01:49:05.900
SHI.42.South.06: from the

606
01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:12.480
SHI.42.South.06: fall from a compliant external complaints, hotel complaints so, and

607
01:49:12.490 --> 01:49:21.569
SHI.42.South.06: with reference to what have been discussed. because they are from who has. I guess you should also a similar case at the.

608
01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.350
SHI.42.South.06: It's a a level.

609
01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:28.240
SHI.42.South.06: so we'll talk about that to be discussed.

610
01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:39.459
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes, On our side, we could give more information on that. So we receive again multiple hotels complain form of fuel to

611
01:49:39.530 --> 01:50:03.679
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: checking or take them take take part in mainly because I'm using the ask for packaging services to the extent that the hotel is asking in the future. Pcg employees if anyone want to pack As for a packaging service, that will be, you know, charge of 2,000 R. And B for time.

612
01:50:03.810 --> 01:50:08.560
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this, this personal individual

613
01:50:09.320 --> 01:50:15.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: behavior plus there are a bunch of external complaint.

614
01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:32.649
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: being route so road to their employees that to attend all to a extent to respect issue and also emotional harassment. So I guess that's that's what we got for you sham

615
01:50:32.730 --> 01:50:38.510
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: similar to what I this is definitely not at the studio model.

616
01:50:38.850 --> 01:50:59.569
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this is true. So so the issue with her was not totally because she asked the hotel to do the packaging for her. It's mainly because she asked the hotel to do the packaging for her, and then she claimed that she lost something, and asking the hotel employee to pay a huge compensation to to for that

617
01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:09.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and during the communication process, perhaps some, you know. you know, not really respect being very rude

618
01:51:09.090 --> 01:51:14.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that that cost the hotels reaction, that they they they they didn't.

619
01:51:14.780 --> 01:51:29.229
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: They actually was okay to help but because of this in several incidences they're not there to do any packaging for us, because they are afraid that we will come in huge compensation from them again.

620
01:51:29.250 --> 01:51:36.019
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. And also, the packaging service is not as once or twice as every check in so

621
01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:41.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's definitely a sort of abuse of their services.

622
01:51:47.330 --> 01:51:56.060
SHI.42.South.06: So let me just say that's why, or you know worse for what I heard right? So like. Sorry for my information. Why is packaging service?

623
01:51:57.130 --> 01:52:01.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I can actually see the language for you

624
01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:23.810
SHI.42.South.06: to the packaging for you, including personal stuff. And then well, well, yeah, let's not go into too much of the details. right? So those behaviors! but I think the key message is so clear, so multiple. vendors and hotels

625
01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:35.230
SHI.42.South.06: Like a complaint, and then refuse to take her as huge guests. This is quite serious, so let's give it up. What child? To say, that's 150,

626
01:52:36.100 --> 01:52:43.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I think.

627
01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:58.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, alright. So moving to next, can I not back one more comments on your yeah. So I actually, I'll check. So for a B transformation, it should be it.

628
01:52:58.930 --> 01:53:04.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So maybe I can for a CPU requirements. Exactly.

629
01:53:06.270 --> 01:53:15.290
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So let's double check on that. Yeah, that will check that. Can we move to my call name first from Jeffrey?

630
01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:20.980
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Yeah. So

631
01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:36.819
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: so my, my call just did a for me their case in the last cycle as a shortcase. A cost office case good feedback. I he got to good medical he's and also faster than a festival board so very effective.

632
01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:52.020
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: so I think that's the good part. However, his availability is quite low. so I think now it's still too early on the mature to talk about his promotion given the the committee to ours.

633
01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:54.490
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: and also theability

634
01:53:54.860 --> 01:54:00.770
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: and I think maybe it is also even the worth, maybe a workout for him.

635
01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:08.579
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: so that he's well when of the availability issues. And then to get get himself on case

636
01:54:19.670 --> 01:54:22.620
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: he's My! My! My colleague

637
01:54:22.630 --> 01:54:30.220
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  I think he has a lot of There he is, challenging

638
01:54:30.340 --> 01:54:35.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: in stopping. I'm not sure whether there's any

639
01:54:35.650 --> 01:54:43.330
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: talent based, or Vpl. Who is willing to staff him except Sharon.

640
01:54:43.740 --> 01:54:46.099
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But you even for I,

641
01:54:46.340 --> 01:55:04.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: in case they charged her Carlyle. And she she she did. She didn't want to. take him as a first party. So That's the biggest she was. He was pretty previously on reply, because of that. But the still, I mean, I don't see any

642
01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:09.419
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: any improvement in terms of his stability.

643
01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:17.169
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: But would it be possible for him to get on some midnight cases.

644
01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:20.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We we can. We can try. But

645
01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:24.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I mean it. It would be equally difficult, because

646
01:55:24.810 --> 01:55:33.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: he he has not never been in doing cases in the mainland, so nobody really knows him. If we don't

647
01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:36.550
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: like, invest him.

648
01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:41.179
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's It will be still very difficult.

649
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:45.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so he cannot be staffed in Taiwan right now.

650
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:47.880
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: What?

651
01:55:49.170 --> 01:55:54.520
TAI.Yuguang Island: Just don't know I just don't know. Yeah. Hello, Nanny, this is Sharon

652
01:55:54.950 --> 01:56:05.540
from type of office. So I think Michael's situation in Tai pay. Is that not a lot of Ppls. Would like to staff him, because I think

653
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:35.260
in the previous case experience the ppos. Doesn't think that he's very strong. he was on my case last year, and he was performing oh, fine But I think due to my current case is a Pmo. That we need someone quite well, I'm sure, to face a client directly. most of my team members are are C, so it was quite difficult for me to staff him as well. It's not really a match. So

654
01:56:35.260 --> 01:56:45.380
yeah, currently, in Taipei, I don't think a lot of pdos are willing to take him. That's what Michael just mentioned. And there's nothing I can personally nothing I can do.

655
01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:49.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I see. So thank you, Sharon?

656
01:56:50.130 --> 01:57:04.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I mean, then it's a it's a tough case, right even though we want to help him. That but it seems that to his. You know, the lower staffing priority for many of the Ppls in Taipei.

657
01:57:04.730 --> 01:57:08.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and he's already 26 months.

658
01:57:09.010 --> 01:57:17.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So even though we we can try to invest him on the mainline cases. But it's quite difficult for him to turn around at this tenure.

659
01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:23.360
SHI.42.South.06: Okay?

660
01:57:23.790 --> 01:57:33.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And 26 months associate, only 14% case availability on

661
01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:38.330
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: wow!

662
01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:41.470
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: It would be a pretty top case.

663
01:57:42.910 --> 01:57:55.069
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for now we we probably should put him on that. But in a long longer term we still see very a lot of challenge for her for him to turn around. So maybe

664
01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:59.799
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Jeff Jeffrey might need to help us to manage

665
01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:01.560
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: is expectation.

666
01:58:01.850 --> 01:58:08.969
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Yes. yeah. So what? When he was on the web that I've been like sending a message to him that he

667
01:58:08.990 --> 01:58:13.700
HKG.37.111.GreatWall:  he he is to. I mean.

668
01:58:13.770 --> 01:58:25.329
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: for example, at least getting in touch with them. And then, maybe not case, but like proposal opportunities. That is something that that he should proactively. See opportunities to

669
01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:37.600
HKG.37.111.GreatWall:  yeah, he he actually is quite proactive. I mean, he has very good attitude. And I think he's a nice guy. It's just

670
01:58:38.630 --> 01:59:00.149
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: yeah, I think he he can do some case as well like Sharon. the case that he was with Sharon and some of the cost office. He. He did those things quite well. But then also you have 30 days of his time. He also have some monthly days. So that's why he, the type of emails and not so keen to take him as a party associate.

671
01:59:00.570 --> 01:59:07.909
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: So yeah. I I mean, I, if refining the thing that we need to do to like at least get some opportunities to

672
01:59:08.050 --> 01:59:14.979
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: to get exposure to to projects that that he needs to work on. Maybe that's that's something that we should do for him.

673
01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:26.839
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Oh, my, we would be easy if he's on that, that that he's at his festival. but it is

674
01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:34.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, definitely and we can try doing vacuum on to main line.

675
01:59:35.150 --> 01:59:45.469
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I I think we can certainly do the investment. But I think as one Pcg concept. We everyone should try hard to give him a second chance before we say No.

676
01:59:45.570 --> 02:00:05.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we cannot, you know, just let sharing as one person to save everyone. Right? It's just not possible. But if indeed there's not, you know there's no room for him. I I think you know, sooner or later we will make the decision. But before that, Michael, maybe let's also talk to the Taiwan P teams.

677
02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:12.180
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: at least, I think he he needs a, you know. Second, try, if it still cannot work out. I mean.

678
02:00:13.340 --> 02:00:14.040
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah.

679
02:00:14.500 --> 02:00:18.750
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: yeah, that's better than reasonable for Michael.

680
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:32.899
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Because let's be honest with ourself. Right. we can invest him on mainland cases. But I with this current case, pipeline even for the mainland, the S. And C. So I think you know.

681
02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:34.720
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: you know

682
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:44.470
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we don't have much opportunity that many opportunities right? So I think both us and also, the talent team needs to give a give a try.

683
02:00:44.970 --> 02:00:45.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

684
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:56.919
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: yeah, it's even better. I mean, I i' a transferring tool. Prove himself or not that he can. Well, with the pals there. Right?

685
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:58.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

686
02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:09.589
SHI.42.South.06: the years people really like 26 months. I'm looking at the the total hours community hours. And also the I mean, we all know. That's

687
02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:12.019
SHI.42.South.06: it. It's not possible. Right? So

688
02:01:12.130 --> 02:01:16.759
SHI.42.South.06: it's this is a a career transition.

689
02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:21.519
SHI.42.South.06: So I think it's they let you put that that right now and then zoom up.

690
02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:30.370
SHI.42.South.06: It's it's it's it's very. It's difficult to to stop. And very difficult to.

691
02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:34.460
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yep.

692
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:38.270
SHI.42.South.06: Yup.

693
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:40.839
SHI.42.South.06: it's already 26 months.

694
02:01:41.180 --> 02:01:42.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

695
02:01:42.230 --> 02:01:46.350
SHI.42.South.06: that's always time.

696
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:55.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Good to next the day, I think. Kay asking you to help.

697
02:01:56.350 --> 02:02:17.129
TAI.Yuguang Island: Yeah. Yeah. Case on client meeting. So I I him to cover so for the I think The comments from the Po is that she the candidate has a good potential and a strong capability. But I think the main issue is the availability is still low.

698
02:02:17.540 --> 02:02:19.559
I think.

699
02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:31.560
TAI.Yuguang Island: Yeah. I think Kay mentioned that John has been looking for cases, but nothing really come up. So that that's the main issue.

700
02:02:32.430 --> 02:02:36.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Well, she's a a a another difficult

701
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:49.599
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: discussion, I guess. she I I think the the conclusion from last ABC. Was that we we need to find her available case because all her previous setup points were investments.

702
02:02:49.650 --> 02:02:53.319
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So it took took us quite a while

703
02:02:53.410 --> 02:02:58.549
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to find the a real billable case, which is currently shut down.

704
02:02:58.980 --> 02:03:09.889
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I guess her performance is, it's okay, but it's just that. She came in with a a, a, a, a long tenure. Then

705
02:03:10.210 --> 02:03:14.719
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all of a sudden, she just at the promotion window.

706
02:03:15.900 --> 02:03:19.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So that's a and she hasn't fulfilled the scp yet.

707
02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I see the.

708
02:03:26.130 --> 02:03:30.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But the the environment is still low, and

709
02:03:31.250 --> 02:03:37.579
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this long run away from promotion. So

710
02:03:38.710 --> 02:03:42.330
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm not sure Sharon did Kay talk to you whether

711
02:03:42.450 --> 02:04:00.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: he would propose to. Yeah. So so I I talked to K. I think the message is that considering the low availability is probably better to discuss in the next cycle, not this one, because it's obvious that not up for 27 months

712
02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:10.490
SHI.42.South.06: it should be. It'll be a real flat case.

713
02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:16.150
SHI.42.South.06: We look at the the

714
02:04:19.130 --> 02:04:26.360
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: if we

715
02:04:30.210 --> 02:04:33.540
SHI.42.South.06: every year today's I've since since it's a

716
02:04:34.620 --> 02:05:01.670
TAI.Yuguang Island: yeah, because So so I think from the Adc perspective, the performance and the score was not very off it. It still has it on track, but probably because taking too much tenure when enter Bcg, so maybe not reflect, but probably considering to cut part of the tenor, to give her a long longer. run away? yeah, a full discussion.

717
02:05:03.630 --> 02:05:19.999
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But what is she doing? Oh, she or she he doing? If there's currently a available case. And, as I said, I mean, the 5% was on was mostly because we had to find her available case, I mean per her last Cdc conclusion.

718
02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:34.599
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So no longer investment has it had to be available. So it was quite hard to to find a fully available case. So that was why she was. She was. she had been like on on the beach for for for quite some time.

719
02:05:35.540 --> 02:05:41.729
SHI.42.South.06: Why is it difficult to find a available case for her? I mean she has been over with us for already for 2 months.

720
02:05:42.370 --> 02:05:44.730
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: No, only 12 months, I think

721
02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:50.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so. well.

722
02:06:02.770 --> 02:06:09.250
SHI.42.South.06: so with 40 miles in school can I find the available case? I think it's a it's a clearly a of that case.

723
02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:14.480
SHI.42.South.06: I mean, if you want to keep it a fair bar.

724
02:06:16.140 --> 02:06:16.980
Nice.

725
02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:22.799
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's stopping. Stability. Has a nation like this is definitely not a 27.

726
02:06:23.050 --> 02:06:27.830
SHI.42.South.06: Then if there is a staff, if there is no issue, then we'll keep

727
02:06:27.920 --> 02:06:34.479
SHI.42.South.06: it go in and to see it necessarily right. But if there is a a significant stopping issue, and then it could be.

728
02:06:34.630 --> 02:06:35.420
SHI.42.South.06: oh, that's that.

729
02:06:36.410 --> 02:06:40.910
SHI.42.South.06: Well, yeah, that's why. What's reason that she cannot be stuffed?

730
02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:47.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: To be honest, to be honest, if we are checking other 14 once 8,

731
02:06:48.660 --> 02:07:01.289
SHI.42.South.06: many of them cannot be staff 100%. To be honest, I mean, in fact, we're we're talking about the year to 85%. So we're asking why she is not stopable this year.

732
02:07:03.310 --> 02:07:07.499
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I think my Michael just said that is because.

733
02:07:07.630 --> 02:07:13.340
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we're trying to find a fully available case for her, and that's take a longer time.

734
02:07:13.570 --> 02:07:14.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Bye.

735
02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:32.699
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. By the way, she she cannot be formidable. There must be reason. Is she capability still significant? Let's see, I I don't see any any capability reason. But so that's why I'm saying, if we are taking other 12 to 15 months, a

736
02:07:33.420 --> 02:07:36.009
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: many of them cannot be

737
02:07:36.170 --> 02:07:49.050
SHI.42.South.06: so given the situation. I guess it's it will be helpful to put her on the raft. That because because she can be, you know, investment for a case

738
02:07:50.290 --> 02:08:18.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she's currently on, I'm a available case. Right? Yeah. So so if we were another cycle, we we should see improvement. Availability, I think, is probably going too far from to to to for reflect. Maybe if we want to pay extra to pay attention to that, maybe a watch out and tell her that the consequence could be reflect, and since she's already on the case, should we wait for another cycle?

739
02:08:19.530 --> 02:08:34.200
SHI.42.South.06: But I guess I mean sorry. But if you look at all the other associates on the following pages, like with the 15 or even 10 months, the availability. There are, of course, a few very long availability, but the majority of them have reasonable availability.

740
02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:39.170
SHI.42.South.06: So if she is not stuff, or there must be reason

741
02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:53.589
SHI.42.South.06: for 5 months that she cannot be stopped. Yes, and I was also on a check. Shevin for her current case if she finished the current case. Well, she finished, the

742
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:57.480
TAI.Yuguang Island: no, no, I have to ask Michael. Sorry

743
02:08:57.940 --> 02:08:59.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I don't think of a basic

744
02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:05.379
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I Cp, I mean, after she finished this case, I don't think she fulfills scp.

745
02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:16.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's only 3. It's only 3. It's only 3.

746
02:09:16.630 --> 02:09:28.709
SHI.42.South.06: So this is the case, and this is the case. Anyway, she will be put on the rest of that. I guess she won't be promoted. It's more 13 months

747
02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:37.539
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Sorry. Sorry just to clarify. she might, if you receive a score better than 2 or

748
02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:40.140
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: about she might.

749
02:09:51.900 --> 02:10:02.609
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Nadia, and she's an I don't. Yes, I think the work of a current case a a a sheet and phone as well on the right track.

750
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:05.079
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: As for some depression.

751
02:10:05.970 --> 02:10:09.979
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, can can we maybe 10 to the

752
02:10:10.470 --> 02:10:19.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to discuss? And I carefully with you those associated with tenure 12 months or 14 months and and back.

753
02:10:20.150 --> 02:10:20.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because

754
02:10:21.100 --> 02:10:37.189
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the reason I'm I'm kept saying that maybe not a replac is because we have tons of associate and not being able to 100% billable. case right now, if we're putting jail on that, then we will have like 2130 reflex today.

755
02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:40.550
SHI.42.South.06: I mean, she is a single digital.

756
02:10:40.890 --> 02:10:48.439
SHI.42.South.06: I just wanted to see that though the the actual Tedio for her is 14 months. But you know

757
02:10:48.520 --> 02:11:00.820
SHI.42.South.06: that the actual header is 26, so we cannot compare with her versus the other, a one, a 2 with 14 months. And you.

758
02:11:01.250 --> 02:11:19.750
SHI.42.South.06: But I like this because, yeah, because she has the vulnerability issue and it, and already 20 months, 10 years. So I guess she compared with Jenny and Michael. I I think the same situation is is similar. I I guess no reason that we put Michael on the red flag, but not to change.

759
02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:38.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, maybe. Let's let's put on reference for now, and maybe let's celebrate together later. I'm sorry that Danny. Michael is already all right. So Michael is the the staffing.

760
02:11:38.740 --> 02:11:49.270
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, yeah, I think it's different. But that's kind of a later

761
02:11:52.270 --> 02:11:57.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm moving to next lunch chain. Jason. Erica.

762
02:11:58.690 --> 02:12:26.629
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, Jason is a very strong pace for 27. He's I think he's very well-ed, I know very good, strong problem solving a comprehensive cases. good analytics, especially modeling a very scientific approach. And and also he also made amazing performance on

763
02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:33.869
SHI.42.South.06: and client communication. very, very.

764
02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:44.880
SHI.42.South.06: And so very call as most State plan communication especially given his reason a project as all transformations. There were a lot of

765
02:12:45.370 --> 02:13:01.619
SHI.42.South.06: a lot of on charity discussions, especially on the head count With clients. Jason made an excellent to for his argument with strong evidence, and also, I think I received very good feedback from

766
02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:23.230
SHI.42.South.06: Ppl. And Mdps Alex and Chicago may also comment on his performance, but, after all, I think with her consistent performance, very good ability as well as a a Good scoring and he's definitely a a strong case for 27 months.

767
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:27.450
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, that's a good.

768
02:13:27.650 --> 02:13:30.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. I'm looking at this, for I'm

769
02:13:32.140 --> 02:13:35.449
SHI.42.South.06: alright, that's that's all about.

770
02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:40.779
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes, we will, next one is.

771
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:51.489
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then next one all on. Call me so.

772
02:13:55.610 --> 02:13:56.300
Michelle Ma: Yes.

773
02:13:57.580 --> 02:14:14.920
Michelle Ma: and yes, I think all and and overall all one is performing very well of the time. So He is very consistent in feedback, either one or 2. And I think for total, a bit of it is also very positive. if we look at the number

774
02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:30.040
Michelle Ma: so based on a feedback from from Cp, I seem to be Japanese. And I think it's probably about about average standards. So yeah, so, okay, can you show his number

775
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:32.160
SHI.42.South.06: should remember

776
02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.560
SHI.42.South.06: break that number?

777
02:14:35.990 --> 02:14:36.730
Michelle Ma: Yeah.

778
02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:45.059
Michelle Ma: So I think he has also. also completed the Sdp, right?

779
02:14:50.440 --> 02:14:51.350
SHI.42.South.06: Yes.

780
02:14:52.110 --> 02:14:52.810
Michelle Ma: Yeah.

781
02:14:54.150 --> 02:14:58.689
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. It looks like in a clear case. Yeah, very good.

782
02:14:58.750 --> 02:15:02.970
Michelle Ma: But a proposed like 12 to 15 months, and on Indian weekend

783
02:15:03.150 --> 02:15:12.329
Michelle Ma: so sorry it's in 2424 to 27. And we need to be a comparison with the with the bash, and it's

784
02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:15.980
SHI.42.South.06: that's that's for the honey, for

785
02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:17.930
SHI.42.South.06: so I'm 27.

786
02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:22.130
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So so since then, so there is some

787
02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:35.430
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: you know we we cannot discuss right now. but there is some investigation going on on open. So let's we can finish the Atc discussion on him. But the promotion decision has to be pending.

788
02:15:37.130 --> 02:15:39.790
Michelle Ma: Alright, let's talk later.

789
02:15:40.680 --> 02:15:42.709
SHI.42.South.06: And excellent.

790
02:15:48.200 --> 02:16:13.510
SHI.42.South.06: Okay shuffle So so far, I used to spend a lot of time on website. So very high for me on that one. And then after the last the cycle, we suggested that he actually should have more and to do a lot more other topics. So he's now working in Cg cases. So I talked to one to his latest, a little member case.

791
02:16:13.510 --> 02:16:33.509
SHI.42.South.06: he has demonstrated his fast and learning into the new, actually, and also but continue to demonstrate very strong problem solving skills. but I think he's according to the feedback, he's not a 24 months. case! So we can discuss his promotion next time.

792
02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:36.840
SHI.42.South.06: It's probably like a 27. Yes, yes.

793
02:16:37.379 --> 02:16:42.430
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. Next one. Okay. Jay.

794
02:16:42.490 --> 02:16:45.930
Jay Lao: yeah. for Kaylee, I think.

795
02:16:46.020 --> 02:17:04.720
Jay Lao: her availability. It's a it's a it's a bit low overall. I think I I mentioned this last time with her. she actually this staff on new cases. So that's better. scp, yes, overall case performance to but I have some concern over her problem solving because

796
02:17:04.860 --> 02:17:08.049
Jay Lao: I think her her case is.

797
02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:13.440
Jay Lao: or the module is not really very tough or very problem solving oriented

798
02:17:13.490 --> 02:17:22.519
Jay Lao: So I would say, 24 months is is now a solid case for 24. I I I would say, let's review her for the next cycle.

799
02:17:23.330 --> 02:17:31.530
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thank you. I think Channel is here. let's let's talk on for a second.

800
02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:44.880
Chenao Yu: Yes, I. A mail j is a consistently very strong feedback and high availability. And also I I believe he has completed a Cp, I mean, I mean for the past, like

801
02:17:45.139 --> 02:17:50.009
like at least 3 cycles I've consistently received like very strong feedback

802
02:17:50.030 --> 02:18:09.390
Chenao Yu: for him, like problem solving individual ownership all dimensions. I I seeing like. Let's calibrate based on his course. But I I I think he he might be worthwhile to discuss for early promotion at 24 months

803
02:18:11.340 --> 02:18:23.880
SHI.42.South.06: so for a while it's not my case before again. A very, very strong, a in terms of analytics. And previously you also handled this did fine meeting independently

804
02:18:24.254 --> 02:18:46.709
SHI.42.South.06: for physically, before the case starts. you know they are facing the clients. You find some loan for a month just handling their request on the international market, which was a complete blank for Also our case here. So because it's definitely a very strong a, it's probably one of the strongest

805
02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:55.609
SHI.42.South.06: in the platform with before. So they still support for him to have our early promotion.

806
02:18:55.709 --> 02:19:20.180
SHI.42.South.06: and looking at, I think the last 2 2 Zoom Phone accountability far from the the other PA cases. So one is for, probably for the the other is probably for cp, so the the the third from the last was the one in Dallas into one. that was second part of 2 month cases. that's actually what we

807
02:19:20.240 --> 02:19:23.049
SHI.42.South.06: so overall there is.

808
02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:43.339
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Now it is co-court averages 2.1 8. We do see pump of score with the one in, and that one is actually under Megan for you, flight is potentially

809
02:19:43.469 --> 02:19:49.080
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so. We calibrate that into a 2. If that's the case.

810
02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:56.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and this call forward average will be 2.3. If that's the case, it's not to 24,

811
02:19:58.090 --> 02:20:00.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: not a 24 promotion.

812
02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:05.889
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and 2.1 8 now is really at the bottom line.

813
02:20:05.900 --> 02:20:09.880
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'll tell you if we are going to the calibration page.

814
02:20:10.880 --> 02:20:15.850
SHI.42.South.06: So the cohort was his whole Api

815
02:20:16.430 --> 02:20:19.889
SHI.42.South.06: like that all over 24 months. Tenure for him.

816
02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:25.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

817
02:20:28.270 --> 02:20:34.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So for this one. for current collaboration, the lowest cover we have is 2 22

818
02:20:35.410 --> 02:20:42.400
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and 2.8 is really borderline. And if we, we we really want to push for calibration, then

819
02:20:44.380 --> 02:20:49.279
Chenao Yu: I think that

820
02:20:49.320 --> 02:20:56.620
SHI.42.South.06: is it only for that one we calibrate it to a 2, or for the other 2 in covering 2, 3,

821
02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:02.249
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because it's consecutively to right and in the middle there is a one.

822
02:21:04.180 --> 02:21:08.719
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. But for the last 2 cases it's for, it's it's for funding. So

823
02:21:08.770 --> 02:21:09.930
SHI.42.South.06: whatever?

824
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:14.919
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, but that. But yeah, it is actually a borderline case. So

825
02:21:14.940 --> 02:21:16.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: let's see what

826
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:40.250
SHI.42.South.06: that's power. And then later, you put it in a whole calibration. Yeah, I think it's a borderline right now. It's the scores, and also it's strong. for sure. the scores and All the full of qualities and things together. It's an online 2427.

827
02:21:41.490 --> 02:21:47.740
Chenao Yu: Yeah, I agree. I I guess we don't drop to company into zoom. And let's calibrate and see.

828
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:53.479
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, yeah. okay, so can you talk on Jenny Lee also.

829
02:21:53.990 --> 02:22:03.430
Chenao Yu: Oh, yeah, Jenny. Well, a little bit contact setup. Right? So Jenny coming in with some kenya

830
02:22:03.530 --> 02:22:17.750
Chenao Yu: and and and I think overall for the previous few cases, I think the feedback is is good. And the reason K. Is a little bit donkey score with us 3

831
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:19.649
Chenao Yu: cause it to his tenure.

832
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:43.320
Chenao Yu: So I do a little bit like 3 60 check with this case. So I think the conclusion is, well, at least my perspective is that from the structural thinking page execution there is there. There are some room for for her to improve, and especially in the English

833
02:22:43.350 --> 02:23:10.059
Chenao Yu: written in the verbal communications. There's a little bit challenging, a little bit challenge for her. and in terms of walking attitude, I seeing all, or it might be okay, cause based on the team feedback like, she's still like work till late nights, if needed. But, on the other hand, I also her that she's running late for one or 2 client meetings.

834
02:23:10.250 --> 02:23:31.950
Chenao Yu: which cost some noise right? So. I think I see overall. This is only a one data point, input for the reason case but for the previous cases, and and also the reason why she she was staff on. The reason for case is that she actually is referred by the previous also case, which she performed quite well.

835
02:23:31.950 --> 02:23:44.520
Chenao Yu: so When when saying that I think we would probably need to discuss a little bit to me. At at least, it's a I. I need a like strong notice, or maybe I watch out

836
02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:58.850
Chenao Yu: based on this. But also, speaking back, I I see this is only a one time bumpy school. So maybe let's just discuss a little bit about her. how we should like better position her?

837
02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:05.469
SHI.42.South.06: Oh, yeah, 2210. You. So

838
02:24:06.240 --> 02:24:18.610
Chenao Yu:  yeah. And yeah, actually on that, I I I see a little bit challenge as well, because, like she's coming in with Tanya, which.

839
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:22.810
Chenao Yu: like she doesn't have much wrong way give her her current status.

840
02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:29.149
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. And then when I look at the stuff sports, so all 3 are straight

841
02:24:29.250 --> 02:24:36.230
SHI.42.South.06: in the recent ones, and then the others also have some trees. And so it

842
02:24:36.330 --> 02:24:38.639
SHI.42.South.06: this one of the

843
02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:48.890
Chenao Yu: yeah. So we also like discuss like this

844
02:24:49.020 --> 02:25:05.879
SHI.42.South.06: or like, for sure, I think either this one they're looking at that, and also what you what you just said. Okay, the English, your production qualities and the Pl needs to rewrite it so that either a red flat or a pen you cut.

845
02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:17.590
SHI.42.South.06: I still still have a all straight like street.

846
02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:18.590
Okay?

847
02:25:18.970 --> 02:25:19.660
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hmm.

848
02:25:21.060 --> 02:25:27.300
SHI.42.South.06: yeah. So which one would you? You say? the would be

849
02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:29.999
SHI.42.South.06: better to help her.

850
02:25:31.730 --> 02:25:35.909
SHI.42.South.06: all right. But does that she has a capability issue

851
02:25:38.970 --> 02:25:40.580
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: any?

852
02:25:42.290 --> 02:25:49.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I, yeah, I think it's still okay stopping. Why? So I. I think I think she's okay.

853
02:25:49.930 --> 02:25:50.920
SHI.42.South.06: Okay.

854
02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:56.779
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Maybe that's

855
02:26:01.180 --> 02:26:02.460
SHI.42.South.06: so again.

856
02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:10.590
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: maybe that's a for a tenure. If that's the case, it's starting, it's not an issue. And this is about.

857
02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:19.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And yeah, that's yeah. It sounds like a better.

858
02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:21.169
SHI.42.South.06: I need 6 months.

859
02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:24.599
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But channel, let's communicate to her

860
02:26:24.620 --> 02:26:30.180
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that she need to pay attention to not to be late on client.

861
02:26:30.580 --> 02:26:37.059
Chenao Yu: That's that's already integrating the feedback from Pl

862
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:38.540
Chenao Yu: to her.

863
02:26:39.990 --> 02:26:40.800
Chenao Yu: Yeah.

864
02:26:40.930 --> 02:26:42.549
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, thank you.

865
02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:47.140
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right. Moving to you also it was a tenure cups right now

866
02:26:47.470 --> 02:26:59.859
Chenao Yu: for how? How? How much mouse like? Typical? Because I'm I'm still. It's a little bit of it, because it's like, I'm not experiencing this in such cases, right? I I think I think roughly, it's a little bit

867
02:27:00.100 --> 02:27:08.530
Chenao Yu: like, what's what's our typical like harshness between record and tenure, cut like which which is like

868
02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:11.690
Chenao Yu: a a more automatic move relatively

869
02:27:14.010 --> 02:27:18.099
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: well, I think 100'clock is just to get them a longer round by right?

870
02:27:18.570 --> 02:27:19.490
Chenao Yu: Yeah.

871
02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:26.810
Chenao Yu: Cause. Yeah, to me. Actually, I'm more, more more inclined to tenic as well. but just to us, any chat

872
02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:33.850
Chenao Yu: cause, I think, like reflex. It's a little bit too much because of like only one Bobby, call right. If if she continue to perform too

873
02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:41.489
Chenao Yu: we might just keep it as is but 10 to the 6 the 6 months, or is 3 months possible. What's that? What are the typical moves?

874
02:27:41.570 --> 02:27:53.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Well, I think 3 months won't move the need, though. 3 months, then she will be 23 again. That's next cycle. and then still I I don't think she will be ready for a promotion.

875
02:27:53.380 --> 02:28:00.370
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So maybe a long runway would be helpful for her. And really some some of the pressure.

876
02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:05.150
Chenao Yu: Hmm, okay, okay, let's let let's go with that.

877
02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:09.839
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, thank you. And this one is

878
02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:33.330
Yue Hong Zhang: sorry I was in there. Yes, so it's homes case the following right? So she had could start in the beginning. So receiving, like, you know, decent feedback as the information she come from. Propaganda. Right however, you know, like, since last year I actually didn't have actually a food case.

879
02:28:33.330 --> 02:28:44.300
Yue Hong Zhang: So the last cycle in the case we discussed was actually a k one with Charles that she did. And since then she's been actually helping on Bd.

880
02:28:44.450 --> 02:28:56.889
Yue Hong Zhang: you know the feedback on that specific there one was that I was a pretty good right? But obviously we don't have any additional data part right? And as she is getting close to

881
02:28:56.910 --> 02:29:10.770
Yue Hong Zhang: to promotion window, right? And I think you know. I she's facing a bit the same issue as some of the you know, in C at the same Kenya. Right? So a you know a senior enough to be considered, but not

882
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:30.939
Yue Hong Zhang: probably first picking how much staffing. So I think it's a it's a pretty you know. it's a it's a pretty tricky case, right? So one the I mean, I think this for discussion, right? One, though if we we we we need to like put her is on on watch out a red flight to find her more opportunity to have

883
02:29:35.410 --> 02:29:46.519
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah She had well, stopping, as always always been being her issue since she since she joined the firm.

884
02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:49.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: She tried Cp

885
02:29:49.970 --> 02:29:59.509
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but it didn't work out, because what the she she? Apparently she had a consumer web. Well, the general account so I think she has.

886
02:30:00.030 --> 02:30:04.709
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she has established some reputation with with the insurance team. But

887
02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:13.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: there's not many cases for for her insurance cases. I think she is me

888
02:30:14.010 --> 02:30:23.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: staff or another. She what? What? Yeah, she's I found that the insurance case I just just recently

889
02:30:23.470 --> 02:30:24.799
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: just on it.

890
02:30:26.950 --> 02:30:31.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But with this level of availability and also scores.

891
02:30:32.830 --> 02:30:39.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it seems like a

892
02:30:40.790 --> 02:30:47.080
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think the if we're putting in I think premium was the Danny right?

893
02:30:47.110 --> 02:30:59.450
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hmm! On the right side with similar availability. But Danielle has no stuff in issues. And this one we have that the issue, then this one should be a reference as well. Yeah.

894
02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:04.860
Yue Hong Zhang: okay.

895
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:22.639
Yue Hong Zhang: I'll communicate to her to her. But I think like she, since she is a just got into an insurance case like I said, you know there is hope that she turn around for the for the next space. But for the moment, considering the current profound, that her tenure right? Unfortunately, she and I just need to be on the right side.

896
02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:24.649
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, yeah.

897
02:31:26.770 --> 02:31:27.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay.

898
02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:30.890
Yue Hong Zhang: I'm back on it just for you, like, how long will it be the case?

899
02:31:31.110 --> 02:31:45.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Is it a long case? Or it's a Oh, And actually the case. Just Paul actually passed this week. The client just came out. That might not be the yeah. Okay. I see.

900
02:31:46.320 --> 02:31:53.529
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: By the way, it's she the local or an angel.

901
02:31:55.310 --> 02:31:58.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, let's move to next bridge and reach out

902
02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:07.500
SHI.42.South.06: quick check.

903
02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:16.039
SHI.42.South.06: Let's go to that. So to the next, Diana, change how this.

904
02:32:17.030 --> 02:32:34.550
SHI.42.South.06: Oh, okay, I think Diana is is on track the previous cases of offered very positive feedback towards her performance. And she's a little bit on the average

905
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:59.800
SHI.42.South.06: regarding the availability availability. But that's fine, I I think now, as stepped on another client case. Right, Michael. So I guess. yes, so it's not a big issue for her. So based on the average scoring. And the I guess she's a a 27 month promotion profile. So we can discuss in the next cycle

906
02:32:59.800 --> 02:33:06.330
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and Ray, I think, in question. And he

907
02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:13.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, shall we move to next one? Emily? Zoom, Natalie?

908
02:33:14.140 --> 02:33:32.509
Natalie Hua: Yeah, Emily was staffed. I'll if I case for Travis for 5 weeks, and the reason why she was stuffed our auto case She performed well on both cases. And she is a fast manner

909
02:33:32.880 --> 02:33:39.850
Natalie Hua: with can do attitude, and she is really strong in problem, solving and written communication.

910
02:33:39.960 --> 02:33:58.479
Natalie Hua: over all. She is well on track, and I think the promotion discussion we can do in next circle. She is catching up on her availability and the fully foundable and also is good in her downward feedbacks.

911
02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:02.590
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay.

912
02:34:02.980 --> 02:34:05.709
SHI.42.South.06: thank you. It's not 24. So that's fine.

913
02:34:06.050 --> 02:34:09.550
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Excellent! they'll see. Yeah.

914
02:34:09.850 --> 02:34:22.129
Michelle Ma: And yes, and she is not actually. I think over she is very well on check on on check. if you look at the number and her case experience she has been stuffed on multiple cases. And so

915
02:34:22.130 --> 02:34:45.889
Michelle Ma: she is stuffable in different pas. And if you look at the number, I think she's receiving continuously a positive feedback from her and her recent case should be. I I got the web confirmation. It should be one, but I think it's calibrated to 2. So nevertheless. if look at the case performance, I think it's very well on check, and the availability is also above average

916
02:34:45.890 --> 02:35:00.960
Michelle Ma: But to to be fair whoever Richard, the downward feedback score is 2 point something. So in my point of the I think it's say, maybe, and 27 profile, and maybe it's fair to per and the to

917
02:35:02.070 --> 02:35:05.370
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thank you So next step to be discussed.

918
02:35:05.410 --> 02:35:22.440
Michelle Ma:  yes, Bill, Bill, get very positive and strong feedback from people in terms of all dimensions, especially his outstanding problem solving school. Highly impressed by all. Ppf, he has worked with recently.

919
02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:44.340
Michelle Ma: he's a excellent problem. Slover, with shopping him clear logic and self drive all the storyline content on the case with very few guidance, and also he's high intellectual cruelty is highly impressed and always willing to take very challenging piece on the module, and for the reason case, nestle key case. I think he also beginning to do a lot of

920
02:35:44.340 --> 02:36:07.319
Michelle Ma: heavy cloud interactions and the presents very mature presence and a very calm style inclined interaction. Also he could deliver, like formal presentation, confidently with and well respect by the client team. And the let's see, he's a score, I think, is a very good for with 3 ones, for the reasons. 3 cases. And he's con availability is above average.

921
02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:18.110
Michelle Ma: while the total ability is a little bit like low, and for the scp, I think he's already he will complete by tomorrow. Actually. So just a few days.

922
02:36:18.430 --> 02:36:25.849
Michelle Ma: And I the proposed 24 months that moment. But also, maybe you wait for a collaboration with the peers. So yeah.

923
02:36:27.280 --> 02:36:33.600
Michelle Ma: and also, I think he's currently stuffed on that. So case and the movie, I maybe can as some words on his performance.

924
02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:47.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. So I'm currently so as Michelle mentioned. So he, he's quite strong and in program solving

925
02:36:47.420 --> 02:37:11.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: almost at the the sea level. the the the capability wise. So he he he's able to independently sub program communicate communicate with the kind who was very, very creative logic. and then for his deliables. almost no notification from the kios. So

926
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:37.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: where it stand up, you know, also, for it is lower on the with relatively lower availability. I have to go out because he, he's he's many working for Atmc case. And as we all know, that's a practice has been shocked this year. he, he's actually working very hard on multiple Bds, yeah.

927
02:37:38.890 --> 02:37:43.870
QingYuan Lin 林清源: yeah, this is, I can also comment a bit on his performance on my case.

928
02:37:43.890 --> 02:38:11.889
QingYuan Lin 林清源: also a very strong a, as you could see. And I would like to echo Michelle on problem solving, and he owned the call mode you on this 2 week to diligence case. And the the client is actually quite vicky. if you, this is actually a phase, 3 of the project, and in phase one and 2, the client actually has a lot of comments on the model. And this phase we we pass the model of as well, quite quickly. So without without comment.

929
02:38:11.890 --> 02:38:24.500
QingYuan Lin 林清源: with only minor comments, I will say so. That's actually a really good sign up is being able to drive the Mojo quite independently and quite, quite well. there was also another calling master from Indonesia.

930
02:38:24.500 --> 02:38:54.179
QingYuan Lin 林清源: and they will actually piss off by a previous Pcg Nounesian team in in in the previous case, complaining that the their model was not solid. So you know this to demonstrate that I actually has quite, you know, high expectation on the quote modal. So this case, I I would like to just emphasize that it's a 2 week very short due diligence, and he was able to run the mode of bottom up with on with you know, only initial guidance and alignment in the beginning. But you know wrong the

931
02:38:54.180 --> 02:38:58.830
QingYuan Lin 林清源: model, quite independently. So. The the one is quite solid.

932
02:38:58.830 --> 02:39:21.410
QingYuan Lin 林清源: I I know that you you have the the red color on on my score. But you know, Paige, actually, we we have been discussing a little bit during the calibration process. Right? This is the confirmed result that you know within the case that I was involved. The one is solid. And maybe this is the out of Vp, we need a little bit more collaboration.

933
02:39:23.140 --> 02:39:25.070
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah,

934
02:39:25.690 --> 02:39:30.660
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to to be really fair. just to provide some background to you and did.

935
02:39:30.730 --> 02:39:37.459
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'll talk to me on the collaboration. So he made all that, all his case to be 2.2

936
02:39:37.470 --> 02:39:48.649
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: under his calibration, and I know it's colored in red, as many other Ppls sort of overrated. So I guess this is

937
02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:53.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: From what was being heard. You all might be a strong case.

938
02:39:55.380 --> 02:40:14.040
QingYuan Lin 林清源: Yeah. I was also surprised, a little bit surprised on the total availability, and I think the main reason as money I mentioned is mainly that the Ndp pipelines are this low, and a lot of cases are just quite short. So there's a lot in and out right? It's like a self lounge rep up to kind of thing that delays the

939
02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:17.750
QingYuan Lin 林清源: we're we're we're lower down over overall to the right?

940
02:40:19.350 --> 02:40:20.410
Michelle Ma: Yeah.

941
02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:26.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. So when I hear the committee's view

942
02:40:26.250 --> 02:40:37.839
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: would everyone think that feels for about this reasonable, it's given ytt is slightly low. But call for and top month.

943
02:40:38.170 --> 02:40:54.519
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's slightly lower than the average, because the the nasty case.

944
02:40:55.320 --> 02:41:14.009
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But if we look at the calibration for the past the history, right? If 24 months is basically the fastest promotion. And for all the candidates within the 24 months promotion the scores and availability is is actually much higher, especially on availability side.

945
02:41:14.170 --> 02:41:30.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We know that there are some some, you know, market reason for such local ability, but we should still keep up the standard. Otherwise everyone complain because of the market. you know, the lower availability can still be promoted as the fastest the window.

946
02:41:34.420 --> 02:41:39.189
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also from the hours of you could see on this page.

947
02:41:39.280 --> 02:41:42.970
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Ours is somewhere more than

948
02:41:43.430 --> 02:41:45.599
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 2,500

949
02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:48.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: up to 3,000.

950
02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:51.520
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And do is right now.

951
02:41:52.240 --> 02:41:56.379
Michelle Ma: Oh, 20, yeah. 2,000

952
02:41:59.890 --> 02:42:11.579
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and 3 of the scores are coming from the inflated Mp. That that one actually to us. I'm calibrated. Okay, it's from other groups.

953
02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:25.640
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  well.

954
02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:38.170
Michelle Ma: that's nice. Or like the next. Okay, okay, what's your next cycle? Okay, thank you.

955
02:42:41.850 --> 02:42:45.799
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Next one is 10017.

956
02:42:46.540 --> 02:43:02.049
David Chan: Okay, yeah. For then. So then. So it's a lateral hire with 12 months of the 10 year credit. And then, like since last cycle. He just went out from investment to start

957
02:43:02.050 --> 02:43:24.310
David Chan: really available. And I think, based on the feedback right? And once the get out of the investment cycle. And like that, he start to actually like a pick up in in terms of the performance. So, although he might have a slow start at the beginning with the first couple of cases with as an that investment. But then, right now, he's not to actually show significant improvement

958
02:43:24.310 --> 02:43:45.499
David Chan: across some of the major dimensions, including, like the PP. I work with him like, recognize that he is actually very independent, and then he's able to drive his module very effectively, and then he is also very committed and very hard working. So in terms of the that you wise. He is very strong, and also he learns very fast.

959
02:43:45.500 --> 02:44:08.619
David Chan: and then I think he also is particularly strong in terms of the communications in both, and also written on slides, and that he is able to articulate the messaging very clearly as well. So I think the the main thing in terms of the area for development are 2 things. One is I think he need more exposures in the terms of the real case.

960
02:44:08.620 --> 02:44:21.669
David Chan: to actually really sharpen his some of the problem, solving in the sense that, like, you need to push for more insights to go beyond copies. And, secondly, is that he's, I think right now is still

961
02:44:21.810 --> 02:44:48.180
David Chan: a stick with Otto. I think there need to be balance between the availability and also the pfangibility. But then, I think of course, I think in the short term he's poverty is, of course, to beef up his ability, but then, if there is any chance from starting side that he can actually like to diversify his experiences on like a beyond auto. Then I think that would be great for him to complete his scp as well.

962
02:44:49.260 --> 02:45:02.279
David Chan: But I think in terms of the promotion I I I would recommend to wait to see, to have more stabilize a performance first, and then we can have a more proper discussion about this promotion window.

963
02:45:03.560 --> 02:45:07.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you, David. Do you want to continue on Christina.

964
02:45:07.310 --> 02:45:30.649
David Chan: Yup. Sure. Okay. So I think, Christina, very similar case that. She also just get out from the investment because she is also a little higher, with also 12 year Italian credit, and I think also, like a once you get off from the investment. He she! She got some of the good rating that is rated from the PP there as well.

965
02:45:30.680 --> 02:45:48.579
David Chan: and from some of the core strings right like on the shape great work, a drive module, and also because she is like Ohio. So that's why it's like a he's per maturity in terms of like a managing with the clients, and also pretty much presentation. He's also something that

966
02:45:48.580 --> 02:46:05.619
David Chan: is her spike, I think. the key thing I think similar to that. So right, one is about having more case exposures to really to sharpen his problem, solving the skills to really having some critical thinking. And we need to dispute the insight as well.

967
02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:24.670
David Chan: And then also, the second thing is also about the If she is right now, still very stick with a health care. So I think although again like a similar that she need. But then, if stopping is able to get something beyond the health care that I think will be good to for her to complete the Cp, yeah.

968
02:46:25.040 --> 02:46:40.029
David Chan: but in terms of the promotion window. similarly, I think we suggest a wait, I see, to have a more stable trajectory like in the next few months and then we kind of have a proper discussion about her promotion window

969
02:46:41.250 --> 02:46:45.409
SHI.42.South.06: that a great. So this is not 24. So next time

970
02:46:45.670 --> 02:46:53.060
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so for a motion discussion, we're still having one more from Jeffrey. Tony to.

971
02:46:54.250 --> 02:47:05.700
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah, I think Tony, overall, I mean she is. She is great. So she consistently received the positive feedback on the cases.

972
02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:32.910
Jeffrey Gao: she recently finished 2 cases, or there's one on still ongoing. But the I talk, we suppose the Pm's. I think, regarding the the call connecting skills, she is quite strong and and also probably also can can can say something. she recently working with J down on the that case. But And also I I noticed that actually

973
02:47:32.910 --> 02:47:58.950
Jeffrey Gao: her case, vulnerability is quite a higher, but the total availability is still a little bit lower. I think it this, probably because, she usually just work on the case, she didn't get it on some other, she once or something but but I think she is a quite staffable. So Michael, probably you can also comment. So yeah, I will support for a suggest for 27 months. Promotion.

974
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:03.419
Zhigang Shi: Yeah, yeah, yeah, Tony,

975
02:48:03.570 --> 02:48:05.440
Zhigang Shi: I think she is quite, not sure.

976
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:11.150
Zhigang Shi: and she is also very outspoken in settings.

977
02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:13.920
Zhigang Shi: even though that should just not associate.

978
02:48:14.120 --> 02:48:21.170
Zhigang Shi: yes, I I it so the sensitive question about that just stuff.

979
02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:25.549
Zhigang Shi: again, if I have a quick case.

980
02:48:28.340 --> 02:48:30.280
SHI.42.South.06: you proposed 27,

981
02:48:30.590 --> 02:48:32.739
Jeffrey Gao: right? Well, what? We look kind of.

982
02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:49.639
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, if you're kind of scores wait to the average call for one year it doesn't look like the 27 if we can put a calibration char in here. So for the for the previous ones with 27

983
02:48:49.710 --> 02:48:55.940
SHI.42.South.06: the co-host. Great is one plus something. There's no

984
02:48:56.260 --> 02:49:01.759
SHI.42.South.06: so much of the tool something. And then honey is a

985
02:49:03.310 --> 02:49:04.899
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think Connie is?

986
02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:10.989
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hopefully, it's 2 point something she's at what they're doing, I guess.

987
02:49:12.990 --> 02:49:17.870
SHI.42.South.06: Let me check. Oh, the other way. Yes, yeah, she said. The bottom line.

988
02:49:17.970 --> 02:49:19.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she said, the borderline. Yeah.

989
02:49:30.990 --> 02:49:37.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So the consideration would be whether that the in the hours sufficient to to support.

990
02:49:41.770 --> 02:49:43.330
SHI.42.South.06: I think.

991
02:49:43.370 --> 02:49:47.429
SHI.42.South.06: compare with the economy right of. I guess

992
02:49:47.710 --> 02:49:52.120
SHI.42.South.06: these 2 candidates are a bit different, Turing.

993
02:49:52.730 --> 02:50:00.429
SHI.42.South.06: and I guess a totally its total availability in the past 12 months is in the border, in the 4% and 20%,

994
02:50:02.760 --> 02:50:03.680
SHI.42.South.06: the

995
02:50:04.240 --> 02:50:07.710
SHI.42.South.06: and score wise. Yeah, it is, too. Yes.

996
02:50:08.210 --> 02:50:15.719
Jeffrey Gao: yeah. But but but Chinese accumulative hours is a long, because more than

997
02:50:17.370 --> 02:50:19.480
Jeffrey Gao: Let me.

998
02:50:20.080 --> 02:50:22.349
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think all works are

999
02:50:23.450 --> 02:50:27.470
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: relatively reasonable.

1000
02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:34.400
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Not I, not at a high point. But then I have it to be reasonable. So

1001
02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:41.299
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it might be a discussion on availability. How come? The availability is bottom 20. The hours is

1002
02:50:41.700 --> 02:50:51.809
Jeffrey Gao: yeah.

1003
02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:56.650
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: doing much of the following cold or tier one. Right?

1004
02:50:57.140 --> 02:51:02.199
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah. But I think we should encourage for the case the client availability.

1005
02:51:02.650 --> 02:51:14.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And to think it another way is because we have so many associates new associates in investment. So their kids availability are all 0

1006
02:51:14.740 --> 02:51:17.339
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that drag the

1007
02:51:17.570 --> 02:51:19.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: average down as well.

1008
02:51:20.990 --> 02:51:23.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Can we look at Tony's data. Again.

1009
02:51:25.290 --> 02:51:29.560
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Tony's client mobility. Maybe because then about the

1010
02:51:29.630 --> 02:51:34.299
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: not okay, she did, because some of part of the case were

1011
02:51:34.800 --> 02:51:40.819
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for global here. One code. If so. there's a longing call.

1012
02:51:42.850 --> 02:51:50.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But her. But her case was not a issue. Going back previous page

1013
02:51:50.390 --> 02:51:52.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the summary page, or on Tony

1014
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:05.960
SHI.42.South.06: on it.

1015
02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:10.070
SHI.42.South.06: But

1016
02:52:11.530 --> 02:52:14.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: no

1017
02:52:18.900 --> 02:52:22.670
SHI.42.South.06: here to, indeed!

1018
02:52:22.790 --> 02:52:24.960
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that was much better.

1019
02:52:25.610 --> 02:52:36.110
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, in terms of the availability. Much better. So I will put 20 still next time. Right?

1020
02:52:42.270 --> 02:52:53.249
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah. But but but why? Why? We need to say we we we compared these 2. But I think Tony is at the bottom line for 27 bounces, then we should

1021
02:52:53.430 --> 02:52:56.590
Jeffrey Gao: right to compare with the previous batch.

1022
02:52:57.130 --> 02:52:59.290
Jeffrey Gao: Not that just the pitching these 2

1023
02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:03.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we we did compare so for their increase. Right?

1024
02:53:03.730 --> 02:53:10.529
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And I think it's still on availability. Are we? Okay with this availability?

1025
02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:18.859
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah. But but what we are talking about the ability is total bit of a not case, but a bit of direct.

1026
02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:21.540
Jeffrey Gao: It's it's it's it's quite strong.

1027
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:29.950
Jeffrey Gao: I mean, in the cold hall. It is a 44 right. But they just read them today getting slightly download.

1028
02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:39.059
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. But, Jeffrey, all the scores both on the average scores availability.

1029
02:53:39.070 --> 02:53:52.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It seems it's a really a borderline candidate right? And this year, for all the borderline candidates given, there's not enough availability, and we tend to be more conservative rather than more aggressive.

1030
02:53:57.370 --> 02:54:08.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So average score is 1.8 8 and cohort average, or what a 2.3 2 even fall into the the, the the cohort for even fall into the

1031
02:54:09.450 --> 02:54:11.000
SHI.42.South.06: 30 months

1032
02:54:11.120 --> 02:54:12.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: more like a 30 month.

1033
02:54:16.470 --> 02:54:20.080
Jeffrey Gao: Okay, can I take a look at the the history?

1034
02:54:20.430 --> 02:54:23.330
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: celebration page? Sure.

1035
02:54:25.430 --> 02:54:30.290
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So many. Yeah, it's actually the school are more like a 30 months

1036
02:54:33.790 --> 02:54:35.820
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: saying calibration page

1037
02:54:50.000 --> 02:55:11.060
Jeffrey Gao: So regarding the bottom line, we say, is because I'm looking at the 27 masses right? The one year. I found something 1.9 2.0 or something. Right? So her Co one year is 1.8 8. You should be fine, right? But the what we are talking about is, there is her cohort with the average? Right?

1038
02:55:11.730 --> 02:55:13.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Yeah.

1039
02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:21.779
Jeffrey Gao: But also in 27 months, we see, like a 2.3 4 2.5. Right?

1040
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:27.760
Jeffrey Gao: So I'm just wondering why she didn't really fit into this ranch.

1041
02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:36.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, if you're looking at those 2.5 and 2.3 4. Their availability are

1042
02:55:36.780 --> 02:55:43.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: around 60, right? With

1043
02:55:44.850 --> 02:55:48.120
Jeffrey Gao: so this

1044
02:55:48.710 --> 02:55:51.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this is, I think it's case availability

1045
02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:55.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: one year. Yes, one year.

1046
02:56:06.750 --> 02:56:11.940
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, I think it's a it's

1047
02:56:13.050 --> 02:56:16.150
SHI.42.South.06: generally. Now, you you open with it.

1048
02:56:16.770 --> 02:56:24.139
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah, it is it? Yeah, whether we show here is the case. But I'm fine now. But just to double check. Yeah.

1049
02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:26.270
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, okay.

1050
02:56:27.550 --> 02:56:31.580
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. So I think we, it's my church that.

1051
02:56:33.910 --> 02:56:38.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Yeah. Can you talk on right chance?

1052
02:56:40.590 --> 02:56:44.359
Richard Guo: yeah. Race is well on track.

1053
02:56:44.540 --> 02:56:49.259
Richard Guo:  So he He said. In

1054
02:56:49.980 --> 02:56:53.430
Richard Guo: step forward in in different the PA,

1055
02:56:54.420 --> 02:57:01.389
Richard Guo: I think also he he the feedback from Ppl. It's just quite consistent. He got.

1056
02:57:01.650 --> 02:57:05.029
Richard Guo: I think. Sorry to in in different cases.

1057
02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:06.989
Richard Guo: so.

1058
02:57:07.740 --> 02:57:20.919
Richard Guo: but he also he, even when he when he needs vulnerability. he he did a few cases with it's long enough, and and you are that so? A challenging case? But

1059
02:57:20.970 --> 02:57:27.969
Richard Guo: he also. still. Okay. Sorry to. So he, he! He no problem about his performance.

1060
02:57:30.750 --> 02:57:31.640
Jay Lao: Yeah.

1061
02:57:31.810 --> 02:57:40.470
Jay Lao: if I if I can add a few points on Ray, I think I'm working with him now. He's very good in analytical thinking

1062
02:57:40.600 --> 02:57:43.379
Jay Lao: problem solving and the conceptual framing.

1063
02:57:43.650 --> 02:57:50.180
Jay Lao: I think I give her one this project, but I think the the cut off it's up to May.

1064
02:57:50.260 --> 02:57:54.609
Jay Lao: so probably not showing on this this slide, but very solid

1065
02:57:54.720 --> 02:58:01.470
Jay Lao: in terms of, if a 27 case very solid, I I will even try to argue for about the 9 24.

1066
02:58:01.490 --> 02:58:06.889
Jay Lao: But looking at the data, I think. it's it's a very solid 27 case.

1067
02:58:10.670 --> 02:58:13.059
Richard Guo: I agree with Jay. Thank you.

1068
02:58:13.350 --> 02:58:19.759
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright, so we'll put on that cycle to be decided. But I like we a 27 case.

1069
02:58:20.620 --> 02:58:21.380
SHI.42.South.06: Oh.

1070
02:58:21.850 --> 02:58:29.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. So we finish all the a U.S.A. promotion. shall we do the vibration of it

1071
02:58:46.050 --> 02:58:48.060
SHI.42.South.06: so nice?

1072
02:58:51.150 --> 02:58:55.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So we have somewhere 33 months

1073
02:58:56.050 --> 02:59:01.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: then you then you will be cutting the tenure for 6 months.

1074
02:59:01.780 --> 02:59:06.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Town. Now, cousin, 10 to 6 months Simon will be a rest that.

1075
02:59:07.500 --> 02:59:17.839
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And for. Now let's talk on this later, because we have something to discuss So what we next next cycle

1076
02:59:17.920 --> 02:59:19.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 27.

1077
02:59:19.720 --> 02:59:23.819
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And then Tony.

1078
02:59:23.890 --> 02:59:36.569
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and we have you. and also we die for that maybe to be calibrated. and Jason will be 27 months.

1079
02:59:42.760 --> 02:59:50.630
SHI.42.South.06: It's a

1080
02:59:51.730 --> 03:00:13.630
Michelle Ma: Hello, Kenyan. I have a question regarding the theations case, you know. yeah, of course, I think the behavior is is not tolerable, but for internal communication. When we communicate to such kind of cases. On going forward, I guess we will have further, you know, this kind of a similar issues. we still need to have a standard of usage communication.

1081
03:00:13.630 --> 03:00:25.849
Michelle Ma: We cannot say, you know, because you're complaining about the hotel chair, and we need to give a red flag. That's not a a acceptable logic. Obviously so.

1082
03:00:25.850 --> 03:00:52.880
Michelle Ma: I will, I would guess we need to offer very concrete. You know the first of very concrete examples. What kind of behaviors they have done, and what is tolerable what is not tolerable. We need to have a kind of a standard, or you know, many middle of us so middle of a social have a higher standard on service, I think. E. S. This kind of where requirements is is. It is not related to the performance, you know. But where's the bar?

1083
03:00:52.880 --> 03:00:56.339
Michelle Ma: So yeah, I I think we need to discuss this

1084
03:00:56.700 --> 03:01:06.949
Michelle Ma: all. We will have problem, you know. in communication with your associates, and and to control the you know the the the feedback. Yeah.

1085
03:01:06.950 --> 03:01:28.119
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. So totally offline in terms of how we communicate and fully agree with you that we need a concrete message about do send. Don't right. Of course this is not related to the case performance, but also related to Pcg brand. And also potentially, you know, you know, outside of the the the working context.

1086
03:01:30.100 --> 03:01:31.269
Michelle Ma: here's your sense.

1087
03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:36.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Actually.

1088
03:01:36.680 --> 03:01:54.470
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, actually for Jason, I noticed that for his sport it's 1 point my and 2.2 one, right? Yeah. And then just now I have talked about feel so if we go back to the next slide.

1089
03:01:54.610 --> 03:02:01.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So up to yeah, these scores are quite much higher 1.5.

1090
03:02:01.550 --> 03:02:09.170
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And then we decided to put into next cycle, which means at this, which he should be avoiding to the 27

1091
03:02:09.200 --> 03:02:10.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for a while.

1092
03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:20.389
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And then, when I compare this to to associates. I've gone back to the

1093
03:02:20.650 --> 03:02:22.620
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: if we put Jason

1094
03:02:22.750 --> 03:02:32.119
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and of 27, and then Bill, what we have not decided next cycle that it means to evaluate other teams.

1095
03:02:32.170 --> 03:02:34.169
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 4. Yeah, mom.

1096
03:02:34.550 --> 03:02:35.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the wellness.

1097
03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:37.360
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I

1098
03:02:37.460 --> 03:02:42.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that they are what we should.

1099
03:02:50.350 --> 03:02:51.130
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hmm.

1100
03:02:53.020 --> 03:02:54.160
SHI.42.South.06: thank you.

1101
03:02:54.470 --> 03:02:57.840
SHI.42.South.06: I should.

1102
03:02:58.350 --> 03:02:59.150
SHI.42.South.06: Oh.

1103
03:03:01.550 --> 03:03:03.320
SHI.42.South.06: Jason.

1104
03:03:10.390 --> 03:03:14.220
SHI.42.South.06: you told me about you? Right? Yeah, yeah.

1105
03:03:15.440 --> 03:03:29.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And be with that that It was because his availability was not high enough to deserve the most fast window. Right? So he's more like a 27. And we discussed next cycle. Yeah.

1106
03:03:29.950 --> 03:03:31.969
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so how about Jason?

1107
03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:44.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But if we compare the scores, so it's 1.9,

1108
03:03:45.200 --> 03:03:53.450
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then we'll feel he. He has already been off.

1109
03:03:53.460 --> 03:04:03.169
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's sufficient experience as to discuss right? So my I is asking how we value. We need more availability than performance. That question.

1110
03:04:03.210 --> 03:04:06.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So from what I thought is.

1111
03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:09.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we do need our associate to be

1112
03:04:09.870 --> 03:04:21.379
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to within that enough practice and experience. So that's why, we're looking at cumulative hours and also but let's see if other committee never would have comments on this question.

1113
03:04:22.090 --> 03:04:32.379
QingYuan Lin 林清源: Yeah, if you look at Jason's 12 months case with the ability. It's actually not that big of cap right difference compared to Bill. So this bill is actually not that high.

1114
03:04:32.500 --> 03:04:35.949
QingYuan Lin 林清源: if you really need to fully consider that.

1115
03:04:40.210 --> 03:04:46.910
TAI.Yuguang Island: I think I think, Bill, sorry just to clarify the bill we are referring to is on the next page. Right?

1116
03:04:46.990 --> 03:04:48.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

1117
03:04:48.110 --> 03:04:53.669
TAI.Yuguang Island: So the bills, the ability is 37, right?

1118
03:04:53.850 --> 03:04:57.470
Yeah. Here today, 37. And Jason existed. Something.

1119
03:04:58.110 --> 03:05:03.859
QingYuan Lin 林清源: I think easily. We look at the top box. Right? 12 months is 48 versus 39.

1120
03:05:03.890 --> 03:05:07.410
TAI.Yuguang Island: And then the 3 scores are highlighted in.

1121
03:05:08.460 --> 03:05:15.730
QingYuan Lin 林清源: Yeah, as we discussed, the last 2 ones are not. it's actually solid. the only 2 2 should be highlighting. Right?

1122
03:05:16.020 --> 03:05:17.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

1123
03:05:17.140 --> 03:05:23.240
QingYuan Lin 林清源: And to the more you know, previous cases, the most recent cases are 2 solid ones.

1124
03:05:23.500 --> 03:05:29.290
TAI.Yuguang Island: Yes, so so should we discuss whether Bill should be up for 24 months, because it's

1125
03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:34.749
TAI.Yuguang Island: Jason's for 27 bills now 24. If we discuss in this cycle, right?

1126
03:05:35.530 --> 03:05:37.560
It's not really comparable.

1127
03:05:37.590 --> 03:05:44.869
SHI.42.South.06: Oh, no, it's not. It's funny. Yeah, yeah, no, it's Wednesday. It's J, 27 months, I guess.

1128
03:05:46.220 --> 03:05:47.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

1129
03:05:49.170 --> 03:05:58.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So the question is not about whether we should put view as a 24, right? I think we all agree that to deserve 24, we need better numbers

1130
03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:04.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So the question what comes to whether this is also 27 or or even 30?

1131
03:06:04.710 --> 03:06:22.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  but, Jason, it's a that we should compare Jason to the previous historical to see if the availability and the score is within the range. If so, then I don't think we should

1132
03:06:22.440 --> 03:06:24.139
post from that. Yeah.

1133
03:06:24.350 --> 03:06:34.929
SHI.42.South.06: I think we should. in the environment with historical record. And Jason, profile matches availability as well as

1134
03:06:35.470 --> 03:06:40.039
SHI.42.South.06: and consistent feedback from Ppl. And and

1135
03:06:42.370 --> 03:06:58.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, I agree that on this is solid. 27. If you are looking at the scores and also availability, we have pretty much from 40, something up to the highest is 78 to the mostly are 40 to 60, right

1136
03:06:59.090 --> 03:07:00.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: in the past.

1137
03:07:00.830 --> 03:07:20.909
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So yeah, so I think we've been the 27 candidates. there are some varieties, indeed. so if you purely compare between Jason and Bill, it seems that views performance is a is is better. But availability lugging behind. But you will combine all the you know. Factors.

1138
03:07:20.950 --> 03:07:23.469
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: seems okay. Yeah.

1139
03:07:23.710 --> 03:07:42.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Just want to highlight, because we got the same question for a essay to the promotion of 15 months. So please be noted that a 27 month, a 2, 15 month essay to see is the largest of what we have.

1140
03:07:42.720 --> 03:07:48.799
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So that's why we might have that varieties within this cohort. It really contains.

1141
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:53.119
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: many.

1142
03:07:53.340 --> 03:08:17.919
SHI.42.South.06: I think the point about because of the sequel at that point to compare right? It's more compared to they top of the statistic record. So it seems Jason is out out 27 months of promotion. And then it's a question whether lower availability for

1143
03:08:17.920 --> 03:08:24.130
SHI.42.South.06: scoring is okay. But availability is not in the prop out to me almost.

1144
03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:33.040
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. So are we still on the same page that we keep the decision we made?

1145
03:08:33.620 --> 03:08:37.940
SHI.42.South.06: I think so.

1146
03:08:37.950 --> 03:08:40.669
SHI.42.South.06: Right? So

1147
03:08:46.190 --> 03:08:49.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right? And then on this page, we have

1148
03:08:49.460 --> 03:09:00.849
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: me out. Yeah. So 24 border line to be calibrated. And now we have over going to be a 24 month by promotion pending.

1149
03:09:00.910 --> 03:09:08.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then we have Jenny to cost 6 month tenure, and we have also, as a ref, like all other stars.

1150
03:09:08.190 --> 03:09:09.640
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: discuss next cycle.

1151
03:09:15.740 --> 03:09:22.009
SHI.42.South.06: I guess. Now it is not a 24 mass profile

1152
03:09:22.860 --> 03:09:29.390
SHI.42.South.06: in terms of the average scoring core scoring. And

1153
03:09:32.730 --> 03:09:38.969
SHI.42.South.06: if you look at that by his twelfth month as the similar I've stolen.

1154
03:09:39.970 --> 03:09:51.300
SHI.42.South.06: Right? It's the ability. It's 70% versus 81%. And if you look at the cohorts. It's probably

1155
03:09:51.380 --> 03:09:52.810
SHI.42.South.06: 1 one higher.

1156
03:09:52.940 --> 03:10:00.680
SHI.42.South.06: But for the others like, if you think about the calibration right go, and also have 2 ones which can be calibrated to 2,

1157
03:10:01.580 --> 03:10:14.769
SHI.42.South.06: so it versus like as you only have 1, one to be converted to 2. So if you look at the patch 4, it's all choose session. If we see the historical school, I think even older

1158
03:10:14.830 --> 03:10:18.600
SHI.42.South.06: in terms of the scoring, even open, is the borderline, for the

1159
03:10:18.690 --> 03:10:26.309
SHI.42.South.06: open has higher availability. So open, probably, is that 24 months promotion from file.

1160
03:10:26.470 --> 03:10:29.260
SHI.42.South.06: but not for not, you know you.

1161
03:10:30.420 --> 03:10:32.979
SHI.42.South.06: But for this.

1162
03:10:32.990 --> 03:10:34.360
SHI.42.South.06: let's check the day.

1163
03:10:40.320 --> 03:10:43.990
SHI.42.South.06: We have range from 65 to 82.

1164
03:10:44.960 --> 03:10:59.699
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, it's it's much lower. Yeah. So 69. And the her cohort and weighted scoring is not as competitive as the previous.

1165
03:11:00.120 --> 03:11:03.890
SHI.42.South.06: Yes, but here we also have 2 to 2.

1166
03:11:04.180 --> 03:11:06.839
SHI.42.South.06: But but the white year of scoring is quite high.

1167
03:11:07.060 --> 03:11:10.209
SHI.42.South.06: Need to look at helps.

1168
03:11:13.680 --> 03:11:17.440
Chenao Yu: But which call are we prioritizing, or we look at both

1169
03:11:17.970 --> 03:11:19.779
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: what you both?

1170
03:11:24.130 --> 03:11:34.769
SHI.42.South.06: I think Miot, is 2.1 8 or weighted averages is quite lower compared to its historical numbers.

1171
03:11:35.130 --> 03:11:39.530
Chenao Yu: Yeah, I said, it's for the night. So

1172
03:11:43.890 --> 03:12:02.490
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, and that's right there, that actually. So how we treat for like, yeah. So with some. There's the once we type in on 27. It would want to go see? There's only one place a month, and then we want to go, maybe for it.

1173
03:12:02.820 --> 03:12:04.710
SHI.42.South.06: That's for the 27.

1174
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:11.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, that would be a 27 tentative decided next cycle.

1175
03:12:15.330 --> 03:12:17.489
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And

1176
03:12:19.030 --> 03:12:22.339
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: shelly, because we're going to talk about

1177
03:12:22.590 --> 03:12:23.690
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Karina?

1178
03:12:26.850 --> 03:12:29.390
SHI.42.South.06: can we? Maybe

1179
03:12:29.450 --> 03:12:33.060
SHI.42.South.06: zoom out a little bit right now? We cannot see.

1180
03:12:33.260 --> 03:12:34.580
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

1181
03:12:34.660 --> 03:12:36.840
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: on on Korea.

1182
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:45.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Sorry. Maybe. Let me speak Chinese for a a while. Sorry. Sorry, because there's a complicated situation.

1183
03:12:45.280 --> 03:15:52.960
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  no school

1184
03:17:07.370 --> 03:17:13.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that.
