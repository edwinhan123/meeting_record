1
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.549
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

2
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:17.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  and how? Okay? Not watch all then that I think that's all for promotion.

3
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:29.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: dad, you that case, we still remained that that right? Yes, okay. And then moving saying, Please take that.

4
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.440
The

5
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.860
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all that's really cool

6
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.340
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: of 2 to 7, Ted.

7
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think it's still sharing, helping to present it.

8
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.870
TAI.Yuguang Island: yes, sorry. Give me 1 1Â min. Can you pass to the next one and then come back. I I I need to open. Yeah.

9
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:35.370
Michelle Ma: yeah, I single phonesing overall he is on track. And and it's not. He's not touching the with promotion window yet. if you look at the number, I think he's the ability to this year they are relatively lower, I think, in the past, but but still reach the average, you know.

10
00:02:35.370 --> 00:03:00.950
Michelle Ma: in the past the cases, I think he he is receiving a quite consistent feedback. So he's a smart guy. most of the people, I said he can deliver according to the an expected the quality, on the other hand, and many people also get feedback. That he he needs to enhance a like case. Ownership, you know, be more proactive to to strive for the best and

11
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:19.140
Michelle Ma: and and it and dive deeper into next level insights. So I would say, based on the feedback that I think he is a an average, you know quality. among alcohol. So let's see, you know, what's what's his performance on?

12
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.340
Michelle Ma: from ongoing cases.

13
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.640
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thank you.

14
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:38.510
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. I think it's been. It's also due to. He's on a local tier one recently. So the ability but hopefully, he will

15
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:44.180
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: be more stopped on case cases. So that would be, how helpful?

16
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:53.149
TAI.Yuguang Island: yeah, that's why it is. Kevin.

17
00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:12.010
TAI.Yuguang Island: Okay? So so for Susan, tied I think from the peals feedback is the overall performance is solid, and she worked pretty hard pretty efficient area for improvements are like problem solving. And inside generation. The common is that she's

18
00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:25.099
she's not like super star performer, but she's overall on average and on track. So I think she's now just need to do more cases and then get more experience.

19
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.520
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think that's no no issues. And next one is Kettle and young Jackie.

20
00:04:34.960 --> 00:05:02.020
Jacky Lai: So for Kathy, I think the world of her phone and she has a very strong performance. And she's very make sure it's basically when he's handling the clients what you know clarity can handle independently. And also he has very strong printation scale current communication scale. So he's able to manage his a daily client conversation. And also, he's very hot working. Yeah, because we're we're really reliable. And also how over.

21
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:31.410
Jacky Lai: So we're also okay. Back from Ppl April, April, the 2. But the only thing you concern is In the past 2 years he did. Quite a lot of operational case has very limited exposure to strategy case with the impact on her developing risks strong probation skills. I think this is some concern. So in the future, if we postpone, maybe we can put her on some strategy case in the next

22
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:46.319
Jacky Lai: 2 or 3 months to to the tip on the ones, her co-count only skills. he's basically the problem solving. And the story, 9, yeah, the overall. I think it's the performance. It's first one. So no issues.

23
00:05:47.460 --> 00:06:01.489
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thank you. Thank you for the observation. Michael, can we work on that? it'd be help, Jacqueline to get on a strategy case. So we will practice. Yes, if we have chance. it's not super urgent, I think.

24
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

25
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.660
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So next one is Cynthia.

26
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:09.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So

27
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:21.069
Chenao Yu: it's it's quite good like people like her. And I, seeing the call still set is is gradually built up.

28
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:42.200
Chenao Yu: So I I think she's a like depending on the score. Right? And it's 2724 amounts profile. But the only thing is that like, because she mostly does cases in Taiwan right now. All time on case is ATM, T. So I think that's scp is a potential challenge. So so I've already fled this to her.

29
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.140
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright, thank you. And moving to the next one chain from Jeffrey.

30
00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.649
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah, Jen, I I think she's over on track.

31
00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:00.170
Jeffrey Gao: I talk with the she really didn't play finish here my case.

32
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:13.899
Jeffrey Gao: that the oval is on track but but she has some area for improvements regarding really, pushing for meaningful kind of recommendation

33
00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:32.189
Jeffrey Gao: for the client, right? But not just based on what she find out and put on the slides. But I need to really sync a second time regarding whether it is really meaningful and to to a voice on of this. mistakes. I think that's the

34
00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:54.089
Jeffrey Gao: the feedback I got from the Pm. So I think for her it still needs to in a bit runway. to to to to monitor. But I think she also apply for some flexibility, that flexibility program or something. Right? So yeah, we'll have that section later. Yeah, yeah, need to.

35
00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.999
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  you need to, or my, or on the

36
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:12.039
Jeffrey Gao: yeah. She. She also understand the challenge because of the she is facing type a. So that's also a little bit challenging for for her. Yeah, she, I think she is aware.

37
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.540
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay.

38
00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.540
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: next one one.

39
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:27.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right, let's move to next one, Sylvia.

40
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:33.060
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think Cpm is it's on the right track.

41
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.470
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and it I want to share some

42
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:44.539
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  some some updated.

43
00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So one of the case, the the feedback has been

44
00:08:50.920 --> 00:09:20.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: one of the feedback that's being shared in our last discussion is from the Fs case and the acting pis Lisa it is a client facing client facing, and the implementation driven case. So her soft skill and a wellness to to to Lauren, and to contribute is highly valuable from the team and also from the

45
00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:40.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and she she also realized that she she need to pay more attention on her hospital practice. So in her recent case which is the case which the Pr is willing

46
00:09:40.400 --> 00:10:08.869
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and Steven Chen she proactively talked to them that she wanted to practice her important skills, especially her skills. So her slight writing and structural thinking is having improved in these 2 cases. but she still has some space for

47
00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:20.499
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: or detail oriented analysis and the structural thinking with generated inside.

48
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright?

49
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:33.499
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, some snow. Not big issues for her right now. we'll meet you next one Angela Chauvelin.

50
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:51.429
SHI.42.South.06: And her true, the toll is not is on track. She's keeping up with very good trajectory on the scoring, on the feedback, and she has relatively a better availability compared with his peers.

51
00:10:51.430 --> 00:11:05.420
SHI.42.South.06: for peers! The only thing is the scp issue. So I think it's very urgent for her to so that, and because she's facing a Taipei, so all of the case is on Tmt.

52
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:13.560
SHI.42.South.06: Yes, and from single Ppl. And Mdp. So

53
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:18.409
SHI.42.South.06: probably staffing is the next case. Stacking is an issue for her.

54
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:28.020
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, she is open minded to work on the mainland cases. She is happy to travel.

55
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:32.480
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay? So let's see.

56
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.299
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, maybe might help Angela. So yeah.

57
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right, thank you. next one. I'll Richard.

58
00:11:48.630 --> 00:12:02.560
Richard Guo: yeah, tell me, I think she's on track. Oh, I see she she's work a lot of the in in with different people, and, always receive consistent feedback.

59
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:09.400
Richard Guo: and even Chicago reading one in the in the in that cycle the Pr case kind of case.

60
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:18.159
Richard Guo: and I think Johnny now is working on out of case. So she also will resolve the

61
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:21.150
Richard Guo: I see a issue.

62
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:28.869
Richard Guo: and her availability is, yeah, it's just about average now. So 66, I guess.

63
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.640
Richard Guo: so

64
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:39.779
Richard Guo: Oh, well, I I think Johnny is is a pro is like 24 to 27 profile. That's that's evaluate in the next second.

65
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.030
Okay.

66
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm moving to next one

67
00:12:45.560 --> 00:13:06.369
Terri Wan: is so for Sylvia Han over on track and also good traction and performance. She's currently on a relatively long case. so availability is not a problem. And she also work on multiple. Ipa. I talked to the PP. Out that work with her. So she as well like that team players strong in co-on and asses.

68
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:29.029
Terri Wan: And previously this is back around the She need to work on the her output on both written and verbal. So she's already show improvement in the written output. But for the presentation she still need to be more proactive to seeking for opportunities. So this is one of the improvement areas for Sophia to work on, but overall the prob, I think. as a pretty good one.

69
00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.480
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thank you, Terry. So next one, you, too, young Erica.

70
00:13:37.220 --> 00:14:04.489
SHI.42.South.06: I'm sure. Alice, a, we're off it. Associate she's not finishing at Cp and with the Cg connect to be potentially for the includes. We do see that it is improving, but I will be for the approved over the time, and I will see very strong

71
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:20.120
SHI.42.South.06: support from different vpos, and she's very responsible for her own modules, even to make sure she's a And so she's already contributed significantly to beat critic called modulus

72
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:39.019
SHI.42.South.06: and project, and a very smart work I call driven as well as deliver a strong crystal, clear message in slide writing, confident in communication. So I do see that she's high. She's a a well on track

73
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:40.320
SHI.42.South.06: assessment.

74
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:49.189
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. thanks to the next one, will it?

75
00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think?

76
00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:52.500
Okay.

77
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.750
TAI.Yuguang Island: yeah.

78
00:14:54.290 --> 00:15:15.460
So for for Ula, I think. the feedback from the previous budget leaders are saying that. he's quite he he's rededicated, and he can pick up a lot of research on his own. working on work on individually, and especially on some last cases. auto case that

79
00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:41.270
have a lot of expert interviews and have to do a lot of research, and he can put together a good So conclusion. So good attitude good ownership. problem. So area for improvement is on our customer client communication, still a little bit too shy and not really presentable yet, but still on the right track, so overall the feedback from the Ppos are positive.

80
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.919
so I think the next step for him is to get more staffing, opportunity

81
00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.230
SHI.42.South.06: to improve

82
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:58.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: a little bit, but she should just in that.

83
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:03.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So since she has just raised that stuff, you can see another cycle.

84
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it will still be.

85
00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But, Harold, we all they need to pass on to 10 in our water.

86
00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.040
TAI.Yuguang Island: Yeah

87
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.820
out.

88
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:23.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, they can.

89
00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.170
SHI.42.South.06: How? That, too. Actually, okay.

90
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:57.179
Richard Guo:  the why you're you're you're kind of performance. How you you just I

91
00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:35.579
Richard Guo:  So if I want to.

92
00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:40.280
Richard Guo: see

93
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:48.510
Richard Guo: frustrated about her stuffing

94
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:53.690
Richard Guo: in the

95
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.600
Richard Guo: availability

96
00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: originally, you?

97
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:33.130
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  Hmm!

98
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.700
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Right.

99
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:56.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  hmm, hmm

100
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.350
Richard Guo: on that.

101
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:03.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: No, it's actually now moving to next one. A second call. you talk.

102
00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.900
SHI.42.South.06: Okay?

103
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.600
Chenao Yu: Oh, that was that, boys

104
00:22:45.620 --> 00:23:00.040
Chenao Yu: kind of the the I'll kind of feedback to should choose some of the general score kind of sort of how you want to to reply. What teams all the feedback you should. And you actually got to be a strong case.

105
00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:06.560
Chenao Yu: They're a whole nigger. So you just

106
00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:09.330
Chenao Yu: the mail from A to the eleventh.

107
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's quite a

108
00:23:49.770 --> 00:23:55.270
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: oh, now I'm moving to next one. Jack. Holy, yeah.

109
00:23:56.050 --> 00:23:56.900
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: is it?

110
00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:01.470
David Chan: Hey? Hello for Jacqueline?

111
00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:21.040
David Chan:  okay, yeah. For Kathleen. I think. he that she is actually pretty good, and then, like she has been on a good trajectory like over the past. I think what a at least I want to do cycle to get a a consistent and stable tool Since then.

112
00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:40.629
David Chan: I think. there are some of the spike on her that she actually have very great communications and also client interacts things. And also she has been very having a very strong ownership, and then making sure that there has been very active alignment with the Pvpr. As well.

113
00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:46.849
David Chan: So I think these are all like a great thing. And as she is actually a Tda aff related.

114
00:24:46.850 --> 00:25:11.529
David Chan: and the Pv. I work with her also recognize that her expertise and and knowledge individuals side, actually create a contribute a lot of value to the case as well. So I think going forward what she needs, a more exposure is on, maybe the problem solving skills and also, like in terms of the written communications. How she can

115
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:12.700
SHI.42.South.06: she like

116
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:34.360
David Chan: I to create the key messaging in the more Crispr way. So I think as a suggestion like that I have been discussing with the Ppo. I think one is that like she will, or because in the past she have a lot of exposure on the some of the digital type of the project.

117
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:49.690
David Chan: But then, in order for her to actually train up her problem, solving skills good to have her to put on some of the shredder tree case and then ideally be on auto, because I think she still haven't complete her scp as well like because she has been focusing on how to

118
00:25:49.690 --> 00:26:02.430
David Chan: a project. Yeah, I I think that is one thing. And then, yeah, I think, yeah, that that that is the key. Basically, yeah, to actually like have more exposure on problem solving, and also like the fungibility users.

119
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.230
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Right?

120
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:25.499
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. maybe suggest she her to be more open up to other cases. You know she has Tba expertise, but now it is not our at ph, so She still needs to be more open up to other.

121
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:36.840
SHI.42.South.06: I think she was she she would have said previously, on the fi our insurance for a few projects, and that's which to offer.

122
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:41.630
SHI.42.South.06: But I don't know why she has not fulfilled this. The Cpi.

123
00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:50.530
SHI.42.South.06: I think part of it because because because of the investment.

124
00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.020
David Chan: yeah, you don't have a tool beyond auto. Yeah.

125
00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right.

126

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:08.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: move to the individual back. We got

140
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the top

141
00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.280
SHI.42.South.06: that that

142
00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:20.580

150
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:29.960
now, I don't think that John has to do the on the like a popular. I don't see if I can set how to compare a guilty score or something.

151
00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:53.030
TAI.Yuguang Island: Now it was

152
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:58.219
TAI.Yuguang Island: Steve and Santa Fiji Museum are a fact that a long check

153
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:09.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: some of the we in the future when you

BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  can I share it

155
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:41.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  I think team, what happy did the performance? Yeah.

156
00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:49.139
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 18 soils must be a negative.

157
00:38:52.660 --> 00:39:00.229
Lin An: Hmm, the kind of performance it's just an evaluation to the

158
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:01.560
Lin An: the.

159
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.170

BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: there you go.

161
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.220
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's kind of a

162
00:39:47.770 --> 00:40:30.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  Oh.

163
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:07.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I go in the account for sure that now, man

164
00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:44.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  to go.

165
00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:56.629
Zhigang Shi: and that action you should.

166
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:28.499
Zhigang Shi: You should be off the for you.

167
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:43.260
Zhigang Shi: okay. So in the

168
00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so internal

169
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:29.900
Zhigang Shi: to them for more than all

170
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.070
Zhigang Shi: through what that will have to.

171
00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:41.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: what's that about. I want you to.

172
00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:05.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hmm.

173
00:45:34.480 --> 00:46:29.590
SHI.42.South.06:  They're challenging the taste of practices to shut up the yeah, I should do. That's not me. Why, it's

174
00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:11.880
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: how. No, I'm only to next what? you're hosting for us.

175
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.590
Yue Hong Zhang: hey? Sorry

176
00:47:48.970 --> 00:48:13.250
Yue Hong Zhang: your analytical skills. And essentially, a problem solventation. Right? So basically, the that of the thinking, and the structure is not to the level right, which is slightly different from the previous state. But I think it's quite important to to add right. Second thing is also like this slide that's been written and not really graduate. Right? I think. You know, it's I wouldn't say It's a

177
00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:38.680
Yue Hong Zhang: It's a it's a it's a alarming things. immediately, as you know, the scores are quiet or cage right with the competition to a 3, but I think it's also like, I think we deserve a strong one, right? I think it has time to to develop and find find new opportunity. But, as you know, it's at the time where we probably can. Can can be ever a bit more like an informal watch out

178
00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:45.980
Yue Hong Zhang: to to to, you know, to calibrate a bit, and then

179
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:51.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  I

180
00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:42.230
SHI.42.South.06: what you and she' clear and rough that.

181
00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:43.140
But

182
00:49:49.770 --> 00:50:10.229
SHI.42.South.06: what she said, well, what we are, what's your what? She said. I didn't realize. I just through where you are.

183
00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:30.670
Yue Hong Zhang: To be honest, it feels like right. that's the if you tell me, Hi, Jen, so where you. I think it doesn't look good. Right? It also, also, the first window. Actually, we need to add 6 months.

184
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:33.280
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, so you know, 10 weeks

185
00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.279
Yue Hong Zhang: and weeks. Okay?

186
00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:50.070
Yue Hong Zhang: I think it's up to a committee. You know what you're just in your respective ash. In that case, I mean, I. So it's not about this for all.

187
00:50:50.120 --> 00:51:11.709
Yue Hong Zhang: So you got you got the job they were in. So I thought it was like, more like, I didn't realize Then it's actually I didn't realize Then it's actually Then it's actually

188
00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:19.950
Yue Hong Zhang: I I I don't have a strong opinion, but I think you what was it? You know, committee, that's like a red flag would be actually, maybe something fair. Right?

189
00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:38.869
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, how that when you T. And there's some amounts you can actually red, black, and the all-gator jig. capability pushing can be sure you're around cash. In that case the shell and you should. Yeah, you're up to that round. Yeah, yeah, what kind of notes and the wrong potential roots. Should you be in your chat? So can I do a to show up back on

190
00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:47.060
Yue Hong Zhang: exactly, exactly.

191
00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:40.569
Yue Hong Zhang: essentially. That's only behind Joshua, I think. To be honest, what you're not sure about previously how it was. It's set up performance right, actually touches all your shared problem, solving your shit, too.

192
00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:12.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, no, it's it sounds like a reflection. I'll go and head out for 4Â min back in a long time around. I'm sorry I should carry you with.

249
01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:05.800
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

250
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:25.720
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

251
01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:28.270
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: oh.

252
01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.190
SHI.42.South.06: that you all back

253
01:18:51.100 --> 01:19:13.820
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to

254
01:19:48.270 --> 01:21:20.989
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  your whole.

255
01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.900
Yue Hong Zhang: I am.

256
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:32.160
Yue Hong Zhang: okay, so, yeah, surely, is actually, a pretty tricky case, I think, you know,

257
01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:51.439
Yue Hong Zhang: Lisa time. Yeah.

258
01:21:51.440 --> 01:22:09.600
Yue Hong Zhang: But I think that's first point, we basically decrease the tenure because of awesome performance issue, right? And then she basically also, try to get invested and and walk on different projects. Nevertheless, I think the recent project right with

259
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:31.969
Yue Hong Zhang: with a for the name of the anyway. So the recent project was actually on the on, the on, the on the super one with Joseph I for Joseph. and I think you know, like the feedback was I think she was not at the same level of performance as and the expectation of an issue.

260
01:22:31.970 --> 01:22:48.850
Yue Hong Zhang: I she'll probably let me be, I would say, and around the one of our, especially around core, consulting here and the ability to solve issue right? So I think, you know, like we've been trying a lot to help her around, and she's also aware that, you know, she's been

261
01:22:48.850 --> 01:23:01.979
Yue Hong Zhang: struggling in in trying to figure out how to are those core consulting stairs and from problem solving in text here. So I think we're at the stage where, you know, like we, she's probably

262
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:13.949
Yue Hong Zhang: running out of time and all the different way. And we need to make a that decision about what we do about her? Right? yeah, that's that's a bit the situation.

263
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:24.619
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So how are you? Are you saying? we should make city decision, or we may.

264
01:23:25.890 --> 01:23:48.820
Yue Hong Zhang: Yes. So my my suggestion. I'm looking at the the picture right? The the picture seems more like the latest performance of this 3 right and essentially the feedback, the auto feedback. And she's already 26 months. So my recommendation might probably be thinking about transition might be a good option.

265
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:55.520
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, I think so. Yeah, it just looks like that.

266
01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:00.600
SHI.42.South.06: And this is a difficult case. And then a chance to turn around as long.

267
01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:02.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hmm, yeah.

268
01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:06.299
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: do you want to continue with Marvin? Yeah.

269
01:24:06.610 --> 01:24:07.280
yes.

270
01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:16.700
Yue Hong Zhang: I think it's also difficult case. But I think it's The past has been always been

271
01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:34.260
Yue Hong Zhang: right. So the look I mean, I think she he started as a as a you know, as a young consultant, a one, and always had this, you know. feedback to be. Oh, okay, player, right? But not like all performing.

272
01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:56.429
Yue Hong Zhang: And now he's arriving at the stage where you know he's getting closer to the the promotion window, and the feedback is still that he is a locating members, but not worse, is 10. Right? So essentially, he's He's at this stage where it should be fully been about. But they still invest it and doesn't get that traction from the different case team.

273
01:24:56.430 --> 01:25:13.389
Yue Hong Zhang: So look. And I think you know, it's It's it's also a point where I think it's in the in a position where we probably need to make a decision on whether he has a potential or not, and I see his way. he's supposed to turn around to be very difficult.

274
01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:19.770
Yue Hong Zhang: So probably, you know. I mean, he's been on the red flag already for for for one or 2 cycles, too. So

275
01:25:19.930 --> 01:25:25.699
Yue Hong Zhang: yeah, also, probably the transition could be could be potentially considered.

276
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.499
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So that would be another transition.

277
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:58.590
Yue Hong Zhang: Looking at the type of that would be my You know, like how many cycles on the right, on the on the red flag is, too, so that I think, and I third one will be also the all part for him. Right? So yeah. So it's it's it's it's like, you know, the the cut off. And obviously there is a room to debate of a bit to get on that. But I would say

278
01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:03.189
Yue Hong Zhang: I it it doesn't salt on raise number to think about transition at this stage.

279
01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:39.310
Lin An: so

280
01:27:50.390 --> 01:28:12.220
Lin An: Then again.

281
01:29:50.870 --> 01:30:14.080
SHI.42.South.06: no.

282
01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:53.550
SHI.42.South.06: the

283
01:31:53.930 --> 01:31:54.800
SHI.42.South.06: to

284
01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.010
SHI.42.South.06: good. Well.

285
01:32:40.700 --> 01:34:37.640
SHI.42.South.06:  n you, how you could contribute to the digital profile.

286
01:34:37.820 --> 01:35:32.500
SHI.42.South.06:  So far, this is a communication show. Today I'll talk with that. Invent to some to the I should create

287
01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:40.720
Lin An: what's how? The

288
01:36:16.690 --> 01:36:19.780
SHI.42.South.06: oh, you're right now, I remember.

289
01:36:21.100 --> 01:36:23.410
SHI.42.South.06: Okay.

290
01:36:37.170 --> 01:36:52.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's just how you're trying again. If you didn't to ramp up. Then she could you perform?

291
01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.100
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: He's a

292
01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:09.920
SHI.42.South.06: there you go.

293
01:37:14.170 --> 01:37:16.709
TAI.Yuguang Island: Oh, Hi,

294
01:37:22.700 --> 01:37:33.980
TAI.Yuguang Island: So let's switch back to English. Okay, okay, so sorry you guys can hear me. Yeah. So we're talking about Lisa. Right? Yes.

295
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:46.970
TAI.Yuguang Island: Okay. So Lisa. collecting the feedback from her videos. she's well on track. She's very strong with high potential. she's the the strength is

296
01:37:46.970 --> 01:38:13.930
strongly analytical skills. Very self driven strong ownership. And she's do a quite long Pmo case, and got very good feedback. So I think, for the next steps she should start trying other kind of pro projects, especially to help her develop a conceptual problem, solving a skill in the future. But over at this moment her availability is good, and she's well on track, and got very good feedbacks.

297
01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:17.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thanks. Do you want to continue on our

298
01:38:18.460 --> 01:38:36.059
TAI.Yuguang Island: okay? So Irene is a associate type of office. As you can see, her ability is very high because she's. Her performance is strong consistently. She can drive her work independently, have very strong ownership, and she will

299
01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:50.610
TAI.Yuguang Island: even support other team members if her work is finished. So I think overall. I got very good feedback for Irene. Also. You can see that from her evaluation score, so I would say she's a dragon, even close to a star performer.

300
01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:55.969
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thanks moving to next. And you, Joe Elli.

301
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:58.240
Lin An: sure

302
01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:08.060
Lin An: And these 10 years do quite, quite so short. Right to months. but already demonstrated, quite, quite good potential. positive. Add to

303
01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.810
Lin An: it's a a very efficient for deliveries past learning.

304
01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:29.110
Lin An: I think it's just that next level, I guess, is that you know, guys as as as associate with more experience to to drive the the the research draft processes. himself. enhance the presence in internal team discussion and as well. So with clients.

305
01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:30.740
Lin An: I guess it's on track.

306
01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:45.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay? I've been he's well, he's well on track. So he he got a one in his recent health care

307
01:39:45.920 --> 01:40:13.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this is very impressive among or the the pr that quickly emphasize that. He's very solid in terms of primary and secondary research, and he can always dry key insights from those research, and also and also he is strong in both world and return output

308
01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:27.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And also I'm very strong on the ship that in my area for him is his English writing. So in the future we will keep a monitoring his progress in this field.

309
01:40:29.670 --> 01:40:33.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, okay. Next one yearly. Oh, sure.

310
01:40:34.330 --> 01:41:03.919
TAI.Yuguang Island: Okay. So in the overall she's on track. so she has demonstrated very strong commitment to projects. Very hard working, great team contribution. also very self-driven and committed to work. I think. But for her performance. There are some area for improvement, especially on verbal communication problem solving, I think, mostly our core consulting skills. So I think she still have some wrong way to improve.

311
01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:22.590
TAI.Yuguang Island: and availability is rather a little bit lower than the case. W. Is rather lower than others, because she was partially investment in the previous case. But in general the feedback I got from her reveals. She is basically on track and

312
01:41:22.660 --> 01:41:24.249
and very committed.

313
01:41:28.350 --> 01:41:32.270
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, I'm going to next, Harry.

314
01:41:33.460 --> 01:41:51.629
Yes, Harry. He's generally checked in most dimensions from the feedback that I garden. So he demonstrates strong ownership dedication on the work assigned to him. She's strong will of improving hospital and achieve actual progress.

315
01:41:51.740 --> 01:42:12.159
and was also effective in driving a remote and multi To some preliminary team! He was working extensively with Gamma, and, on the other hand, he needs to devolve hyper-driven thinking to be more effective with an identified potential solution to a complex problem.

316
01:42:12.470 --> 01:42:31.349
And however he want me to improve his English, to broaden staffing opportunity in the near future. his current level of English proficiency may present challenges when working on partially with specific English requirement, and that's usually the case for Tabia Office project.

317
01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:42.400
and that feedback is very consistent with the last 3 Ppl. He worked with, so we would suggest that he should take advantage of our Lmd resource

318
01:42:42.530 --> 01:43:05.939
and improve that quality in the near future. Yes, I'll have the compliment, and we? He already reached out to the L. And D. And we assigned him to a language English language program already. So he's currently in the free trial of his English coach. If it goes well, we hope that we can sponsor him within the ridge.

319
01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:13.809
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alex, send me ask a very direct question. I'm sorry I have a

320
01:43:13.990 --> 01:43:14.800
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If

321
01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:22.890
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: most of the cases are in English, then well, Harry, have the similar issue as my calling and Sheila.

322
01:43:23.290 --> 01:43:26.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but not like being able to.

323
01:43:27.690 --> 01:43:35.530
TAI.Yuguang Island: But there's still Chinese speaking cases in telling office, for example, for the Fs cases

324
01:43:36.140 --> 01:44:10.500
with Taiwan and a soap or a guitar. that's all in the corner, so I don't think that'll be an issue. Just so. So. Harry works with me for for Vd. for 2 weeks in the past, in the past 2 weeks, I think. if we can luckily have any potential Fi or insurance pro project in Taiwan because he has the relevant background, I think I will. I will be happy to provide him an opportunity to staff him, so I think his situation is still quite different from

325
01:44:10.500 --> 01:44:24.550
she, like Michael, so I would suggest to provide him some wrong way to develop his English skill at the same time. To enhance his core skills in consulting in other cases. And Then we will see.

326
01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.220
TAI.Yuguang Island: Okay

327
01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:29.540
TAI.Yuguang Island: again.

328
01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:42.270
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Sharon, it's it's really hard to put all the pressure to you right to stop. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I mean, just for me. Right? I can. I can ask if Alex willing from the Ptmt perspective. Yes.

329
01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:43.340
yes.

330
01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:46.629
TAI.Yuguang Island: Okay. So maybe yes.

331
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:53.949
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's why I see for another cycle to see if there's any.

332
01:44:54.040 --> 01:45:00.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Probably, if not, maybe it's fine. It's just

333
01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:03.220
yes.

334
01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:11.020
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright. Shall we move to Patrick. One who? Yeah. hey?

335
01:45:11.710 --> 01:45:32.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  Patrick was working on them. At that case they had been working with an at the In action for a while, and after that she he had been stopped on as a as case. And regarding to the

336
01:45:32.110 --> 01:45:50.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the current review, I I think the case haven't been yet since on the right track, and shows the improvements in in high school, such as the data analysis. And the slide writing.

337
01:45:53.570 --> 01:46:17.139
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, the previous case, the Ella's case is is with me. So Patrick is definitely on track. Just I want to ask a favor. from Louis. You should emphasize to him that she should pay more attention to details. It's not because of the because of his ownership, because she lost her cell phone

338
01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:34.980
SHI.42.South.06: for 3 times. I'm a cases. I think that's because of the personality of characteristics. So he doesn't pay too much of details, so nothing to do with the problem solving the how or it is our excuse. But you need to emphasize this to him. It's a money issue. It's because of the personality.

339
01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:37.760
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, okay, got it. Thank you.

340
01:46:38.970 --> 01:46:41.319
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thanks. Thanks. Travis.

341
01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.290
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: next one. So the you know chat.

342
01:46:47.530 --> 01:46:48.630
SHI.42.South.06: I,

343
01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:53.729
SHI.42.South.06: a toy is out of the room for a 5 meeting.

344
01:46:53.780 --> 01:46:57.180
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay? then. Ryan shoe, Jackie.

345
01:46:58.250 --> 01:47:22.350
Jacky Lai: yeah.

346
01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:36.630
Jacky Lai: Change his personal agenda, based on the from the case. And also he's able to drive from where this small module to go back himself. And the has demonstrated the very strong research and the.

347
01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:59.750
Jacky Lai: And also he's doing well in leveraging internal resource to. So I think in the future, maybe to 2 to 2 areas for improvement. The mind is to for their development. problems only scale, especially how to build the the the frameworks and and is to improve the slice writing skills. To make. This has more concise to work. Simplified. Yeah.

348
01:47:59.790 --> 01:48:04.300
SHI.42.South.06: it's an over one to the on track. where is from potential.

349
01:48:05.220 --> 01:48:07.040
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thank you, Jackie.

350
01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:12.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So let's keep John card and go to

351
01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:32.380
Natalie Hua: yeah, for Tammy. Terry was stuffed Cg case for 6 weeks and flee available She delivered quite good work on the case. And her supervisor, is it she I checked with you, she And she think on

352
01:48:32.500 --> 01:48:48.760
Natalie Hua: having has job ownership and a very self moted and also has good hearts to like data analysis and for areas for development. that she will suggest

353
01:48:50.070 --> 01:49:02.670
Natalie Hua: suggest driving to be more actually play check with supervisors for feedback. and to be most, not in an 80 20 rules.

354
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:07.550
Natalie Hua: So all, she is well on track. And

355
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:21.460
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, moving to next one, Johnny. Still, child, let's get that one and move to me. Call the oh, yeah.

356
01:49:21.740 --> 01:49:26.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So Nicole, I think. she's also on check.

357
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:29.009
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So she has what the

358
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:55.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: in Cp and also want to to transformation projects. she has demonstrated to, where is all at the consulting skills? And also, the ability to support other team members to complete some assignments in the future. We expect her to have a higher ownership and be more proactive to drive thinking, yeah.

359
01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:00.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, going to the next one. Chris, you, Richard?

360
01:50:01.770 --> 01:50:06.600
Richard Guo: Yeah, Chris. yeah, she she's, I think, crazy. We're on track.

361
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:10.240
Richard Guo: So he worked with

362
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:16.939
Richard Guo: different tas and has been staffable.

363
01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:28.639
Richard Guo:  I think he he work quite a lot with with Rena. I I'm sure you've been on the line. But then. probably not gonna comment a bit about that, Chris?

364
01:50:28.890 --> 01:50:38.950
Rina Su: Oh, yes, Chris has been working with me type case and some other Bd work so overall smart. I was almost speaking. I think he's a well on track. Nothing really special.

365
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:42.809
Rina Su: But he's a really good candidate as a associate.

366
01:50:43.100 --> 01:50:45.150
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thanks.

367
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:49.430
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Moving to next one. Nathan C. Remon.

368
01:50:49.970 --> 01:51:06.429
Raymond Tsui: Yeah, I think they can is overall on track work on a few Cg cases, I think recently on lines here with with Aaron John. so apparently he's quite smart, and you know, quite effective and practical as well, and it's up to the free.

369
01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:16.779
Raymond Tsui: The only thing is he needs to be pushed to be, you know, more driven right in terms of owning modules, and the last slate back right, which I will

370
01:51:16.790 --> 01:51:19.629
Raymond Tsui: deliver such a message to them in the next call.

371
01:51:20.340 --> 01:51:25.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, Next one hazel sin Sharon.

372
01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:44.139
TAI.Yuguang Island: Yeah. So ha! So overall. I got quite good feedback from the pivotal. She worked before. She is as strong as a new associate. and she's quite on track with strong performance in

373
01:51:44.140 --> 01:52:07.510
quantitative analysis. Logical thinking so overall we're on track in the future. can have more exposure on compliant communication and to work on her presence because she still look at a big junior and think that's still very normal for associate like her in her tenure. So I think overall she's quite on track and her ability, Illudy is good.

374
01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:36.239
Terri Wan: Okay, thank you. that's all. Name that. Yes, So Linda has some tan over our. When she joined the Pcg. So she's truly on second case, the first case as a course office case with with the Us. Office. So she mainly work with it. Consultant. So there's some setback early on about her call concerning skills. So I get to sit back to Linda. And then there have been probably follow up with that.

375
01:52:36.240 --> 01:53:05.400
Terri Wan: so, as many are our call consultants to on excel like, be proficient about, excel cues and slight writing, and the auto one is more on. She's not being proactive enough to have regular check in with the consultants. so in terms of parties, what the pro prioritizing per task. The consultant feel like a a Linda is more like a black box. So after the setback I I I told I I have a feedback session of Linda Linda already show improvement on that.

376
01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:20.280
Terri Wan: So I think it's in good traction, and her second case is currently on the fi case. there's a lot of has a left to on. Let's just take, and she's she's picking up ping that up and also on her call, considering still. So I think it's an on a good track. Now.

377
01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:26.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, thanks, Karen, so just a reminder.

378
01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:32.969
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think I I've heard from Ppl's actually a

379
01:53:33.280 --> 01:53:38.640
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: feedback on her skill, basic skill on excel and community as well.

380
01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:52.100
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So that one might be some on that.

381
01:53:52.210 --> 01:53:55.050
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

382
01:53:58.290 --> 01:54:02.540
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright. So moving to the next one editor

383
01:54:03.050 --> 01:54:03.840
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to me

384
01:54:14.290 --> 01:54:15.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: any is

385
01:54:15.870 --> 01:54:21.739
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm not here. So next one maybe I can.

386
01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:24.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And then are you back?

387
01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:34.120
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, then to the last one one. Soon long, Jackie.

388
01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:59.459
Jacky Lai: in the last few weeks he works on track In the last few weeks he works on the and the appeal, and also, they'll say, conduct for works very closely with him. He will be high comments about her, especially if he's wherever release and I'm going. In the last few weeks he has a lot of His workload is really heavy. He still can manage it very well.

389
01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:19.119
Jacky Lai: and also he has the and he's just doing the case. He's afraid of our meeting client communication, but we recently he's very active, proactive in in approaching the client. I'm a big on the client. Come, Casey, and also he is very open to.

390
01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:45.960
Jacky Lai: and I'm also I'm also in better to. I can change his daily work, or I things I in the future, as in 2 areas for improve, my mind is to for the problem solving. I think he should be still, continue to improve the problems from scale. And so the second part is a connect to analysis. this, this is something. from further improvements.

391
01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:50.709
Jacky Lai: So I'm frank nothing special to to amazing discuss with here.

392
01:55:50.840 --> 01:56:03.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thank you.  So on this page. let's move back to our earlier page. I think charity will have 2 from you.

393
01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:10.220
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: one is for the next 10.

394
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:19.799
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Yeah, perfect. Can you hear me? Yeah. yes, Felix, is progressing, progressing really? Well, he's done 2 cases

395
01:56:19.810 --> 01:56:41.109
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: in the last one last 5 months or so most of the time we've got one, and the next one it's been a close to one on, on, on insurance which is led by an Mdp. Directly in a and a pl or an ex principle, his knowledge team in Germany now.

396
01:56:41.110 --> 01:56:53.730
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: they. I think the feedback has been very positive. everyone said that they would restore them and, in fact, on the on the tier, one principal from Germany. So, using the top 10%, he's he's worked with

397
01:56:53.730 --> 01:57:15.240
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: very clear strength from so many insight. and it's written communication very, very strong. and and I think in particular, standing out how he sort of pushes. The thinking forward doesn't just accept what's given him. couple of areas development for him.

398
01:57:15.240 --> 01:57:30.200
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: a little bit on how you leverage it 20, a little bit more. You let's get to go deep. And then just a little bit around consistency between between different slides. For that. That was a a a specific case. So I think, generally just on track.

399
01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:46.369
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: the availability looks a little bit low, the 21. But that's because he's been on this tier one for the last, I think, about 3 months now. So hoping to get him to again straight away next week, when he when he rolls off.

400
01:57:47.170 --> 01:57:49.979
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I think overall that is really high.

401
01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:51.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So not too well, we

402
01:57:52.190 --> 01:57:54.830
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: okay. Perfect.

403
01:57:56.570 --> 01:58:19.839
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: any questions on Phoenix? No, maybe continue on chantel. Yeah. Chantel. again. Shots of been been doing good jobs. Been on to a number of these. And then one case, the Svd insurance case. generally, you working quite a lot in insurance and needs to maybe brought out a little bit, just trying to work across other PA's

404
01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:41.019
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: but doing a good job with all of them he's work with on on the first of longer. Dids in the case. Would like to stop for again. good Ps. And I again very independent drives the the storylining and and the and the recession slides quick to output

405
01:58:41.020 --> 01:59:03.210
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: no sort of big no big just just a couple of where where they said, you know, maybe she pushed a little bit further on on. So what and maybe a little bit more practicing in all communication particularly in client meetings. But nothing, I think, to be particularly worried about with Chantelle.

406
01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.890
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: on track.

407
01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:08.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. thank you.

408
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:16.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And let's move to the third page on starting from Ritual Town. Okay.

409
01:59:17.710 --> 01:59:40.410
Jacky Lai: it's it's very good. she's very active. She's very active. I'm very forward to you working attitude. And also she she's a fast.

410
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:54.810
Jacky Lai: and also he's that to in They can communication Even in the internal discussions he's probably actually in and in and speak out his own of.

411
01:59:54.910 --> 02:00:15.099
Jacky Lai: So I said, or one is, we're on track in the future, maybe 2 areas for improvement. One is a full on on this, especially those slides writing scales. can be folder on screen stuff. And the second one is a quantity on analysis skills. yes, this one. It's also another piece of room

412
02:00:15.630 --> 02:00:19.649
Jacky Lai: I'm in between proves. Yeah, that's all. So oral is a humpback.

413
02:00:20.590 --> 02:00:22.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thank you, Jackie.

414
02:00:22.290 --> 02:00:26.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So next I I see it next for our to me.

415
02:00:26.960 --> 02:00:53.980
SHI.42.South.06: you wanna yeah. Yeah. So I I I'll just talk about some time. So as for Jess and and they are. Both of them are python track. good sense of problem, solving for a willingness and motivation to to take challenges which I I think it's great for new bees and also quick learning curves both from both

416
02:00:54.200 --> 02:01:14.940
SHI.42.South.06: but they also need to speak up more in in kind of the internal discussions, and can conduct to send the checks when they when they do a analysis and communicate with Vpl, and also stress that strengths and core consulting skills, including slack writing.

417
02:01:15.370 --> 02:01:21.929
SHI.42.South.06: So overall check on these 2. And to that as well through right through a

418
02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:47.660
SHI.42.South.06: She's actually got some availability issue. because of that he's being staffed on A on a Bd. For for almost a month. It's actually a properly so I don't know but didn't get confirmation from clients for for for really a while. So he himself is actually worried about situation the log in ability.

419
02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:59.550
SHI.42.South.06: yeah. So that's so, maybe we should push him to, to, to, to, to, to to to stuff available cases. You know as possible what? What you right

420
02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:19.739
SHI.42.South.06: and for Gloria overall I'll track as well. But the one one piece of downward feedback saying that she used to enhance thinking, which I think could potentially be critical. But still too early to say

421
02:02:19.850 --> 02:02:26.790
SHI.42.South.06: anything, because just 5 months into to associate Korea. So

422
02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:33.480
SHI.42.South.06: so let's see the the the following, for future.

423
02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:35.730
SHI.42.South.06: evaluations. Gotch.

424
02:02:35.880 --> 02:02:51.369
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, thank you. Me pay attention to Laura in the future, and for jury I think, bill about it is not? It's not that you should ask. she's still new with us. but please remind me that as a new hire

425
02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:56.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: There's I don't see many reason that he or she has to.

426
02:02:56.830 --> 02:02:58.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: For that case

427
02:02:59.490 --> 02:03:08.019
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'll get all, and try to find other cases. I I'm not sure. Why that

428
02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:12.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: on that. So just

429
02:03:15.090 --> 02:03:16.560
SHI.42.South.06: okay, yeah.

430
02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:19.239
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So it's child back.

431
02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:27.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Not yet, not yet. Okay, let's move to

432
02:03:31.060 --> 02:03:43.400
Terri Wan: Yes, I'm here. So may this work on 2 case she previously, or her first case with Pcg is a Dv case. setback is good as a fresh aid. It's on track.

433
02:03:43.410 --> 02:04:00.820
Terri Wan: Can do tars independently, including follow up with vendors and also Pta, so the setback is good. there's clear improvement areas around how to be more proactive or sharing the think and access to internal team such that

434
02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:16.270
Terri Wan: like team can save time and stuff like everyone learning from scratch, and she recently stuff on the auto CD case it's very intensive. But when I talk to her her attitude as very positive that although it's intensive. But it's a very good learning experience for her.

435
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:21.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thanks next one.

436
02:04:22.310 --> 02:04:41.840
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: Sure. I have 4 in this space. So I will go altogether to say some time. so overall conclusion is all of them on the right chat. They are all stuff investment cases back to back and without much issue. All the Vp is ready. Them, as you know, on track with you know, good performance and potential.

437
02:04:42.020 --> 02:05:03.630
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: So in case that case to me is staff on a auto case, and if the Pbi is actually a platinum pia he initially gave him even for up to for a first case. So that's a quite, quite a high comment. And overall she is quite smart and able to take on new content very quickly on a

438
02:05:03.630 --> 02:05:24.600
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: a operation case that no one has a specific expertise and get along with clients quite well. So that's a pretty good case. Moving forward she would be. It would be good for her to experience in practice, article core consulting skills that is not practice in this long case. So, and she's already doing that. So we'll be a good gonna track

439
02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:50.849
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: Nicole was staff on a few Fiji cases, and she's also, you know, did a good job. So the Ppl feedback is that overall needs invitation. There is learning I to to go. Kong's queues that's the highlight, and moving forward is more about it. I'll be more structure or hypo dreaming, you know, communication with more in size and identify next steps, you know, all typical fresh a kind of comments.

440
02:05:51.630 --> 02:06:16.610
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: And Kisha was only on one case and is will it be extended for for more with Malay on a CD case and overall also, there are good on our first case, and the Ppl. Gave her a quite positive feedback on, should being able to catch up the content very quickly and be able to already all in some small modules. And they're proactively in this time to learning

441
02:06:16.610 --> 02:06:30.489
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: and the at the mainly is try to, you know. Be be more cautious of timing try to deliver on time and make sure that pay some sanity check before communicating with Ppos.

442
02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:53.140
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: and the last is She's she she did a a few cases right, and one is with a Ddk, that one is the Cg case that we have on check on on the on the out overall. also right chat. Very good at it to you, always willing to take on new challenges able to deliver on time, and the Pd. Also willing to stop her again.

443
02:06:53.140 --> 02:07:09.730
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: strands mainly is kind of as we discuss this kind of core consulting is locations on all on chat. Efp is try to speak up more and proactively develop next steps and further practice communication to be more top down message to you.

444
02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:15.739
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: So you know, above all, it's all on track now. No, no, nothing to raise as. But

445
02:07:15.890 --> 02:07:18.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, thank you. Senior.

446
02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:21.789
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: next one is Kimberly Chen share.

447
02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:41.329
TAI.Yuguang Island: Yeah. So Kimberly is staffed on Tmt cases back to back as investment. I think her overall is on track she still need to improve core skills, especially work efficiency and effectiveness, and how to prioritize tasks.

448
02:07:41.330 --> 02:07:58.909
TAI.Yuguang Island: so I also ask I, the L. And D team, to support her with more training on the basic skill sets like Excel skill sets. But overall she's quite committed to working on her case still on track, but need to quickly improve. core skills.

449
02:08:01.420 --> 02:08:04.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Do you want to pursue the other one on the page?

450
02:08:05.890 --> 02:08:28.979
TAI.Yuguang Island: Okay, okay. So Jay's similar situation back to back investment in Taipei for Tmt cases. he is quite strong based on what I heard is on track as a new associate very good in quantitative analysis, but still, need to improve communication skills as in the presence.

451
02:08:30.570 --> 02:08:31.250
TAI.Yuguang Island: Oh.

452
02:08:31.630 --> 02:08:35.909
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thank you. next one will be holy, or how? What?

453
02:08:39.620 --> 02:09:01.859
Hanhui Xie: Yeah. So has been stuffed on 3 project so far, and she got a positive positive feedback from Ppl. That she is a hard working, good attitude, and you show strong commitment to the tasks that that that signed to her. And she grow very fast, both in communication with team members and the consulting core skills

454
02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:12.899
Hanhui Xie: as areas for improvement. Maybe she can be more confident in the future to communicate with client team. So I think. Oh, well, he's on track, and very good

455
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:14.469
Hanhui Xie: new day.

456
02:09:15.250 --> 02:09:19.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thanks. Do you want to go for selling? Who

457
02:09:20.090 --> 02:09:23.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the next next one? Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

458
02:09:23.710 --> 02:09:49.649
Hanhui Xie: So certainly, also, she has been stuffed on 3 cases in Pcg and overall. Very good feedback, and she has very good attitude, and there will communicate with Ppls on time to update his progress. And he she is also developing consulting cost skills, for example, exporting views. And for future improvement.

459
02:09:49.650 --> 02:09:55.959
Hanhui Xie: we'll suggest how to do modeling more to practice quantitative skills.

460
02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:02.159
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. just a reminder. How like for Selen, I do her

461
02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:11.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and feedback from Pr that she is very like a student. so my need to

462
02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:27.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to get more. I know that's that may not be easier to solve for me.  yeah,

463
02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:33.490
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So let's move to join the whole charity.

464
02:10:34.630 --> 02:10:40.190
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: yeah. So Jolene has maybe been stopped in a Namura strategy case.

465
02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:52.289
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: donna done a a very strong job on this, from from what I understand. real straight to Ps, my,

466
02:10:52.290 --> 02:11:11.890
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: I'm practicing this needs to work still a bit on core consulting skills, especially around, is storylining and and making that make it slice. But nothing that you wouldn't expect to someone that sitting in here for a few months. so I think she's in in in the right place.

467
02:11:15.270 --> 02:11:16.220
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you.

468
02:11:16.450 --> 02:11:18.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's why

469
02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:20.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alicia, Jack.

470
02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:39.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, I think the Alisha John is still working on the same case since our last to discussion. And the I I think there, there's a different face to since last cycle. The the previous spaces are very

471
02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:51.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the communication, and for current time it is more deliberate. So but a chance to improve her hard skills, such as like my team

472
02:11:51.750 --> 02:12:13.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and the data analysis. And then due to the the the she can own piece of work independently with tiny suggestions

473
02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:16.550
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to to update, to adjust the message.

474
02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:21.059
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I think it is. we are on track candidate.

475
02:12:21.330 --> 02:12:39.140
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We need to see her performance in in the future. Okay, thank you. Next one Alberts in. Oh, yeah. So for he's on track. So he joins the for as a very fresh graduate

476
02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:56.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and at that time he he even didn't know how to use things. So we we have a of the he he's progress. Throughout the 2 projects he demonstrated his capability to develop with the basic consult. He's in a short period of time

477
02:12:56.860 --> 02:13:01.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and in his current case he is to own

478
02:13:01.810 --> 02:13:14.239
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: some small modules with some some opportunities to phone to the clients. So within in the future we will keep a monitors who

479
02:13:14.330 --> 02:13:20.559
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: progress, and hope that it can become more capable and more solid.

480
02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:46.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you, Melania. next one. So Lisa has been stuffed on one global proponal case after he joined the Pcg. And the Pl. Has very positive feedback for him that he is a a very smart and understanding key questions, and the leeja has high, mature level and is very easy to communicate with.

481
02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:55.929
SHI.42.South.06: and he's also a faster learner. You can see Obavier's progress on her slides writing and the problem solving skills during the project.

482
02:13:55.930 --> 02:14:09.340
Hanhui Xie: And Lisa himself called me that. he wanted to be stuff on some client case because he wants to practice some skills like expert a call and a client management.

483
02:14:12.380 --> 02:14:14.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I guess.

484
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:23.919
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. And the easy.

485
02:14:25.690 --> 02:14:27.460
Hanhui Xie: okay.

486
02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:41.069
Hanhui Xie: So Italy has a 3 data point after she joined the Bcg, and actually, 2 pls to give negative feedback and one another. One, I think, is neutral.

487
02:14:41.070 --> 02:14:58.760
Hanhui Xie: The poor working act to that has been a major concern. She has been in consistently late for work, sometimes leave early, and it take excessive breaks like she always takes sick leave for different reasons, and, for for example, in her first case

488
02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:06.490
Hanhui Xie: she frequently asked the first to leave, starting from the second a week and then then go off herself, due to a health issue.

489
02:15:07.770 --> 02:15:18.699
Hanhui Xie: Yeah, that is the first case, and after she wrote after himself herself from the first case, then she immediately to get herself stuffed on the second case.

490
02:15:18.740 --> 02:15:34.250
Hanhui Xie: and the feedback from the second of Ppl is also nectar. he told me that. if it's often late for work and the lead early. And as for consulting core skills. So she never pushes for insights and a stuff at the overview

491
02:15:34.300 --> 02:15:44.689
Hanhui Xie: like a mix of him, feel that she does not take it as a serious job, and sometimes to reluctant to work. So that is the feedback from the second appeal.

492
02:15:44.830 --> 02:15:49.889
Hanhui Xie: And as for the third case, it is a it is a

493
02:15:50.000 --> 02:16:09.830
Hanhui Xie: okay. Now, they needed to very heavy communication with client team. So the pl, just a release in the third week, because the Pl. Things that Eve is too shy and a difficult for her to directly communicate with client team. So that is the feedback from the case team.

494
02:16:14.230 --> 02:16:28.580
Yue Hong Zhang: So what do we do in this type of scenario? Right? So it's essentially a a performance issue. But there is a trivial it to an issue. Right? So I think. But walk in any job. It's related to walk right?

495
02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:37.780
Hanhui Xie: I think, like, if definitely have attitude issue, maybe staffing team have had some other details about

496
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:43.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: similar to what?

497
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:47.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so sickly about that

498
02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:52.739
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: tools too often. Right? but

499
02:16:53.340 --> 02:17:02.949
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I I just feel that this may not be a super work, for I mean consulting may not be a to work for her, I mean, if she

500
02:17:03.740 --> 02:17:11.230
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: cannot take undertake like pressure, or like she, if she really has some health

501
02:17:11.469 --> 02:17:12.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: problems.

502
02:17:14.379 --> 02:17:26.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I think this is the second case we have talked about today, right? you know as a fresh graduate only a few months with the firm already showing very serious attitude. Issue.

503
02:17:26.879 --> 02:17:28.589
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: doing the work.

504
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:43.010
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I feel it's a to me it's another means higher. If it's only capability issue, we should give people more time to grow and learn right. But if it's a very clear attitude issue, not even showing up at work.

505
02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:52.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  I'm I'm very concerned. Yeah, I I feel this is another case for perhaps that termination during the trial period.

506
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:56.840
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Sorry. How will you have the second

507
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:59.359
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: case? Similar case like this?

508
02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:05.699
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: any views or comments from the committee?

509
02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:25.100
Yue Hong Zhang: I think it makes sense. I I just want to. I I just wonder if it makes sense from this usually point of view, just to feed back to those cases to recruiting right? So if if basically, the rate of Miss Har is going up, then he's a there is something wrong in the process.

510
02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:42.219
Yue Hong Zhang: right? So probably either way, what I've been into the wrong full of panel until there is something you know, in the on boarding process, all the setting up the expectation that was like, right? So I beyond that, I think not. I. I think it just makes sense to to have more. I know a bit of feedback on that side.

511
02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:43.650
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

512
02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:58.570
Tammy Tan: this feedback correctly. I mean recorded, you know, by the score, because I feel if we all give 3

513
02:18:58.719 --> 02:19:18.670
Tammy Tan: to to these 2 cases. It's based on school. It's very similar to the rest. I just I I I definitely support the the. The decision. I think attitude for for for graduate is definitely not acceptable. It's just a I I just want to ask how the process can be taken more

514
02:19:19.219 --> 02:19:22.879
Tammy Tan: legitimately. If the scores

515
02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:24.760
Tammy Tan: appear to me I was free

516
02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:35.609
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: indeed, indeed, so pitchy is it? is this still possible to change the school? Well, technically, yes. But I guess it's

517
02:19:35.990 --> 02:19:38.430
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: per individual.

518
02:19:38.490 --> 02:19:41.340
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Put them in very high pressure. If we pre

519
02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:52.559
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: preset to say we made that decision as you to change this for for communication purpose. I think the will feel pressured as well

520
02:19:52.640 --> 02:19:55.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: do the communication try. But

521
02:19:56.340 --> 02:20:11.329
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, well, the issue is so. You know, the pressure is already there. Right? So we as a firm, if we want to terminate you know, we have to justify. And it's not just the one single Ppl, it's actually multiple. Ppls.

522
02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:31.809
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so let's let's try to have some talk offline to see how we solve this. But indeed, right, even within the trial period, if we terminate. We need to give you know, performance reasons, and giving us score of 3. Indeed, a bit inconsistent from what we heard. during the meeting.

523
02:20:35.610 --> 02:20:36.620
Yue Hong Zhang: I know.

524
02:20:36.830 --> 02:21:03.390
Michelle Ma: yeah, on the other hand, that we need to really investigate it so many executives because she worked on my case in the that's the first case. Every time she tried to leave early or come early, there really always has issues that will basically, as up here I can say nothing. I don't know about the real has issue. But my feeling is that this is a tricky. If the guess is a real or not, you know.

525
02:21:03.390 --> 02:21:10.789
Michelle Ma: But do we have? You know this kind of a like the like a doctors

526
02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:13.829
Michelle Ma: which we found today that I don't know.

527
02:21:15.810 --> 02:21:23.089
Michelle Ma: I think that. Yeah, so it can be checked. Because, you know, all people can say we don't care about the hairs of our employees, you know.

528
02:22:27.860 --> 02:23:23.490
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  okay, So

529
02:23:23.530 --> 02:23:29.029
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so that's a termination decision. But we will see how it goes for processing.

530
02:23:29.620 --> 02:23:31.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So moving to next page.

531
02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:35.139
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Francis, the only shop.

532
02:23:35.900 --> 02:24:00.729
Michelle Ma: yes, Francisco. Actually, that was very a strong trajectory he already gets to from second case, and also on the third. May one. She originally received the 2, but then, due to collaboration divided into 2 half, and I think he has a quite well above peers, and the also expectation for an investment associate. According to his reasons. Pr. He already

533
02:24:00.730 --> 02:24:06.600
Michelle Ma: independently or module work, and also deliver a formal presentation before senior clients, so

534
02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:08.219
so on. Good trajectory.

535
02:24:08.770 --> 02:24:10.139
Michelle Ma: 12 front, if you

536
02:24:11.240 --> 02:24:15.650
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thanks Michelle next.

537
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:42.180
Terri Wan: So Bosco completed. one case, it's on an insurance case in Hong Kong, and he's stopped it to a healthcare case training in Shanghai so to fit back for the insurance cases. very positive. the stream does around a problem softly, especially on being able to do fact-based analysis and rigorous checking and bringing that insight back to the team. So this is the straight and area for improvement is mainly around

538
02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:56.040
Terri Wan: presentation to internal currently, not many opportunities to interact with client. But the presentation, the problem is many around being too detailed and bottom up so that it's not

539
02:24:56.600 --> 02:25:02.210
Terri Wan: it's not punchy and concise. so this one is one of the areas for improved.

540
02:25:03.220 --> 02:25:05.249
Terri Wan: But generally you us from perform.

541
02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:27.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay? thanks. Next one. yeah. They see. Also, show strong momentum on the case. And it's Mary coachable her pl and also consultants. Describe her has, and also she is a quick learner to understand the case. Contact and can come up with solutions, and there no guidance.

542
02:25:27.570 --> 02:25:35.579
Michelle Ma: So for the it may be, continue to develop, and that polish the problem. Solving scubes in future cases

543
02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:38.719
Michelle Ma: overall. Very good. Tech.

544
02:25:39.490 --> 02:25:41.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. thank you.

545
02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:44.100
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: This one your home, Benjamin.

546
02:25:46.030 --> 02:26:12.349
Yue Hong Zhang: Yeah. So Benjamin actually had the monthly started. But the 4 during these first days was a and like essentially that, Rookie mistake was a lot of them, right? So like no weaker problem solving. And somehow I bad English communication skills. The second day it was the 3. So I think you are, I would say definitely, give you a start of start right? But we already to say there is for sure. Not

547
02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:26.649
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, maybe. Remind him him on the basic consulting skill. Because I do see a lot of on that.

548
02:26:26.690 --> 02:26:31.489
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And maybe we we need our so on that as well.

549
02:26:34.550 --> 02:26:35.430
Yue Hong Zhang: All right.

550
02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:38.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Moving to next one

551
02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:50.240
Raymond Tsui: hey? Out here, I think everything is let me see.

552
02:26:50.340 --> 02:27:17.049
Raymond Tsui: you know everything is on track, and no, the scores has been quite positive so far. Right? And quite early on she already bought a 2 despite only roughly, half the a So no, no real issue here. Okay. Thanks. because that's a tough time. So let's just be very quick on the comments Terry, Teresa.

553
02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:25.319
Terri Wan: is it on Tuesday? So yeah.

554
02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:44.290
Terri Wan: Yes. for Theresa. again. second case. first case is working with platinum team on the auto case. second case, currently, it's on a Pmo, so the Theresa show improvement in the first case, to the back is actually quite good. there are some

555
02:27:44.470 --> 02:27:51.189
Terri Wan: hex up like on the first 2 weeks around. how Theresa work with the fender

556
02:27:51.270 --> 02:28:02.129
Terri Wan: technical vendor. But then, she make a significant improvement during the case able to own her her module and directly into work with a client

557
02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:09.739
Terri Wan: working level so that the main improvement areas is around how to make

558
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:15.950
Terri Wan: better use of a busy resources and being more efficient. So generally on on track.

559
02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:19.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thanks nice one, Charlie. Sophie.

560
02:28:30.920 --> 02:28:59.400
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Oh, sorry! Sorry. I've been working on me while since since January. done. It's done a great job according to to ga She'll probably roll off it, surely, because they've got budget constraints for investments. strength in a Psni client interaction with P. And and teams. and a few around, you know you should.

561
02:28:59.650 --> 02:29:01.620
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Okay.

562
02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:06.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thanks. Then, Jaylow, can you talk on the

563
02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:22.919
SHI.42.South.06: yeah So you a, and pr is pretty place with her with potential very, very driven maybe a little bit shy but very clear and logic thinking

564
02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:28.490
SHI.42.South.06: also from the mental of excel. So right on track, let's see.

565
02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:53.539
SHI.42.South.06: And then for for it also. Pretty solid can, you can see is is the learning curve. It's growth. And it's now staff on a pretty long project. So I expect the ability won't be an issue, and also running current will continue to to to to grow. So I think both of them are round track at this stage of the career.

566
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:58.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay? Thanks. Jay. next, John. See? Anna, and

567
02:29:58.680 --> 02:29:59.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: your email.

568
02:30:06.330 --> 02:30:08.629
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's just with us.

569
02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:13.959
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: let's move to channel. you that see?

570
02:30:17.210 --> 02:30:29.440
Chenao Yu: Yeah, it actually is fairly new. I I I think she just get out of the customer. Maybe I I I see all, all. The feedback is good on track, but she still need time to do that at the call scale.

571
02:30:29.570 --> 02:30:35.190
Chenao Yu: I'm not saying nothing. You to raise.

572
02:30:35.430 --> 02:30:38.989
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thanks. it's a

573
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:40.169
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: each one.

574
02:30:48.550 --> 02:31:00.060
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  I think overall she is very well unchecked. So the comment from the Pr is positive, I think, yeah, very simple. I'm check.

575
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:04.600
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay? that's a

576
02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:29.400
Natalie Hua: I mean, that was stuffed called brand new reports for Ss management company. And she called party feedback from and he thinks ninja is has to ownership and learn very quickly. And she also has good analytics views. So where I'm track.

577
02:31:30.490 --> 02:32:00.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thanks. Next one, Jim. Fun. Crystal. Gee, yeah. So he he's a this question. So he to projects the first one is a call project. He joined in the meat of the project, but at least also pricing public. So you consume the topic.

578
02:32:00.450 --> 02:32:24.809
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and the second one is also, strategy projects. So the overall feedback basic the 2 when they pick up the the stress for G, they all pick up one's team contribution. So I think all the feedback is

579
02:32:24.810 --> 02:32:53.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: need to basically start from 0 to build that call. I think it's probably because pitching we've been in the last time. So I've problems the the PPI and also tracks with background. He has the college and the and the master in in London. So all like younger than other and also he's learned he's studied

580
02:32:53.890 --> 02:33:07.809
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think so. Probably a nice I especially I especially

581
02:33:07.820 --> 02:33:23.900
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so, I I think first

582
02:33:23.970 --> 02:33:48.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: very eager to be in the because, like the the like. Hard to do the the Sanity chat. you know, it's it's very, too. It always active. We ask feedback, but I can't understand that you you do that. Do your own job, check the number and the

583
02:33:48.140 --> 02:34:08.930
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also the PP, I'll feel if you can not be deal with the work on time if I turn to. tell me earlier, but I I can understand. It's not piece. It's the issue. It's probably just the now it's capable. And it's not mean a he can all make the number whatever he he can do.

584
02:34:09.140 --> 02:34:24.730
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And the second one is a local team. I think we've got much more training. And the coach for this project at least a shop home. and there is a but a very typical 8 weeks strategy

585
02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:31.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but still, I see.

586
02:34:31.520 --> 02:34:41.010
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we say, if you need to kind of hold me teaching how to do the the

587
02:34:41.270 --> 02:35:06.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so or 3, you know you've got to learn. I can you to? Well, very waiting to. I'm part of the working so. But I think we may need some discussion on his full file. And and the case basically has a very weak start. And we cast, too.

588
02:35:06.090 --> 02:35:24.119
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: our life. He spent, you know twice, third time that other you learn the call consulting skills. If we allow for that, otherwise it will be also a longer pick up curve compared with the normal us new associate we we have.

589
02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:29.230
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So how do we want to handle this kind of situation?

590
02:35:30.930 --> 02:35:35.460
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. bye, bye.

591
02:35:35.900 --> 02:35:43.170
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. But comparing to the other 2 people with

592
02:35:43.180 --> 02:36:11.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: some time to learn. Right? Yeah. the shop on the suggestions he give to to him because he learned with that I think he also probably. Well, he's interviewer is in pis. So that's why I thought he advice the the interview or social call suggest team to actively try to find the Ps project to see whether he can

593
02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:14.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: like, have stress in those topics.

594
02:36:14.770 --> 02:36:25.499
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But definitely, we, we cannot have associate only focus on certain type of projects. So that's the of the Spanish. But in terms of development

595
02:36:25.540 --> 02:36:44.940
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I will think it's probably helpful to find another project. He can  like, easier to to pick up. And the demonstrates the potential. If we really find the in the first project, we still question about the

596
02:36:44.980 --> 02:36:48.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: potential You probably have

597
02:36:49.230 --> 02:36:50.470
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 2

598
02:36:50.580 --> 02:36:52.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to just think about that.

599
02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:58.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: He's 4, and he's for us so

600
02:37:01.900 --> 02:37:08.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: well. But we we don't have many city planning cases right now, right? And also

601
02:37:09.360 --> 02:37:22.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: he needs to learn the other skills. Yeah. So I guess we should put him a a normal case. And the try to find a Ppl. Who can be, you know, give more coaching, and

602
02:37:26.890 --> 02:37:33.549
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but I feel for this case. It's a a bit too harsh if we, you know, communicate right now, you know.

603
02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:35.290
SHI.42.South.06: Yes.

604
02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:53.449
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. Maybe this keep a close close on him. And yeah.

605
02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:05.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to to do so. Otherwise it's really hard for me. Yeah.

606
02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:15.099
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. so let's just pay more attention from now and give him a another case.

607
02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:25.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So for the set of time. I'll quickly drop the names and see if there's more issues coming out. For the rest, few

608
02:38:25.840 --> 02:38:28.140
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: would be

609
02:38:28.460 --> 02:38:32.559
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Florence and the pension.

610
02:38:32.910 --> 02:38:36.559
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then Lawrence, the John and Aaron.

611
02:38:37.080 --> 02:38:38.929
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Is there any issues?

612
02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:46.720
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If not

613
02:38:46.770 --> 02:38:52.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think, Tina, you have an S. A. Not prevented. Yes.

614
02:38:54.260 --> 02:38:56.189
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: I think all my A's ever send it.

615
02:38:59.790 --> 02:39:03.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, it's

616
02:39:07.840 --> 02:39:11.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. Can you talk on Johnny piece?

617
02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:29.040
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: Oh, I thought that was, yeah. Evan also is doing good. on his first few cases. I think his first case was remote and and he doesn't have much training yet, so that one

618
02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:46.119
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: wasn't very, very helpful, but the future 2 cases. So the ppos gave pretty good feedback in terms of very fast to, you know, ad to learning, and also quickly, you know, get the hands hands on kind of a performance.

619
02:39:46.120 --> 02:40:12.879
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: his strength as a Phd higher right is quite professional at climate control was able to. Especially the the the current case that he's working on The most recent case which is require a lot of client communication. It's very clear that he can already on some communication in the tent only, and all the region and communication and and verbal communications already in took place.

620
02:40:13.250 --> 02:40:26.259
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: the Afd is mainly in trying to be more concise and trying to be more singular when it comes to some technical terms, because, for one of the the case that he was on

621
02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:47.839
QingYuan Lin ææ¸æº: the client was less sophisticated like a local client. So that was kind of like feedback. All the things I think is not like any flag or into work. You just need to practice. you know, more on the core concerns queues. I think the the trajectory was pretty good, as I could see. The the comments from PPI is like getting better and better.

622
02:40:50.830 --> 02:41:07.899
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, thanks. Chow, are you back with my child? You you talk on the 4 you have. it's just so, you see, is very well on track I feel that, you know so.

623
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:24.570
SHI.42.South.06: good! I think it's a Fs, you know. So right now it's on Cg case. So we don't worry too much on her well, on track. and second, I think it's a a done time.

624
02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:39.539
SHI.42.South.06: so yeah, you see, also a lot of reason, too. So I I think she's well on track. Jean-pie. feedback is okay. But I think her. I think this poor issue is on availability. She's also.

625
02:41:39.750 --> 02:41:58.949
SHI.42.South.06: actively seeking opportunities to be staff on case like a to try if there's any available cases. But if it's right now, as it's partial investment, that will also be beneficial for him. But the key is to help them.

626
02:41:58.950 --> 02:42:17.560
SHI.42.South.06: get on case As soon as possible. And Next one is speak one. And she's also a well on track. Availability is okay. And also being consistently a staff on case. Finish one

627
02:42:17.560 --> 02:42:38.750
SHI.42.South.06: last December, and also one to in the last 2 months. I think she's also being staffed right now on case So what we've already too much Sol is basic skills. And also good communication the last one. I think it's any chat, right?

628
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:59.539
SHI.42.South.06: oh, oh, yeah, any like our tenure is quite, quite, quite short by now. But I'll manage her very good feedback on her from her first case and also the current case where the beyond didn't expect her to have such independency, and also

629
02:42:59.730 --> 02:43:23.540
SHI.42.South.06: Third mastering of the of the of the module, and initially they were trying to staff another a to help her on the case, but I'll help her on the module, but essentially they think that any quite good, so it will probably put that into one module, so I don't need much effort on her. So overall also very long track

630
02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:25.560
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: included.

631
02:43:25.950 --> 02:43:28.840
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And then

632
02:43:28.940 --> 02:43:38.840
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: time of time's sake. we still have 2 from Kenya edit, though, and anything to highlight or any issues.

633
02:43:41.890 --> 02:43:48.830
Tammy Tan: both of them are well on track. I will not talk about the details. But nothing, not not not issue, no issue.

634
02:43:48.890 --> 02:43:51.909
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay? And also for sky.

635
02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:58.469
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  I think for a is there anything to highlight or issues.

636
02:43:58.590 --> 02:44:02.189
Lin An: No, she's she's on track good performer.

637
02:44:02.570 --> 02:44:04.070
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, thanks.

638
02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:07.949
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And Chunky is still not back then.

639
02:44:12.300 --> 02:44:14.149
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So

640
02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:22.940
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so I think we'll finish all the discussions. except that we have a few more from

641
02:44:23.860 --> 02:44:27.550
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: from Allen. John. it's not here.

642
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:35.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also 2 more from John C. And that's all that those 2 from to you. I guess there's not much this

643
02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:37.889
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to talk about. I'll check with them.

644
02:44:37.990 --> 02:44:45.019
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I'll fly, so let's move to the last set section for flex, please.

645
02:44:45.410 --> 02:44:46.180
Yeah.

646
02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:48.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we have 2 candidates

647
02:44:48.970 --> 02:44:58.639
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for application. One is Lawrence, 10 he's preparing to study for the for Mba

648
02:44:59.030 --> 02:45:04.899
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and the other one of the right she I think she has some

649
02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:08.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: family.

650
02:45:08.670 --> 02:45:14.080
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So for these 2 will be for one with 2 months.

651
02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:30.239
SHI.42.South.06: I I would always. Lauren is super strong, right, and should be fine. And it's so. The time is well used. It's yeah.

652
02:45:30.350 --> 02:45:31.839
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and not to me

653
02:45:34.090 --> 02:45:35.339
SHI.42.South.06: great to you.

654
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:38.099
SHI.42.South.06: for the house

655
02:45:42.090 --> 02:45:42.940
there

656
02:45:46.770 --> 02:45:51.909
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: think which the only concern would be her availability. Right?

657
02:45:52.140 --> 02:45:52.850
yeah.

658
02:45:55.480 --> 02:46:04.889
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So just a background for all the flexible leave or flexible month program we only endorsed to those with very

659
02:46:04.900 --> 02:46:06.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: outstanding.

660
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:15.290
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'll I'll send in 10 the candidates cause benefit then I O, a program.

661
02:46:15.390 --> 02:46:18.820
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: what health insurance are? Psr, those kind of stuff?

662
02:46:19.430 --> 02:46:23.990
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so the only concern for you would be the

663
02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:26.840
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so any

664
02:46:28.820 --> 02:46:30.180
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: comments.

665
02:46:40.640 --> 02:46:50.450
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: partly because she hasn't been on projects for a while. But all the feedback I have

666
02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:18.779
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she currently on.

667
02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:22.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. And so so let's leave this right after that case.

668
02:47:22.750 --> 02:47:29.609
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so that would be very limited influence to the

669
02:47:29.830 --> 02:47:32.990
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: second. Then there's no time. Gap.

670
02:47:35.770 --> 02:47:40.229
SHI.42.South.06: What do you think of the second one? So the flex lead. But

671
02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:46.090
SHI.42.South.06: usually it's given only to the top. A strong player, the strong performance. Right?

672
02:47:46.390 --> 02:47:47.350
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

673
02:47:47.650 --> 02:48:00.649
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. I think in terms of performance. For all the I I think, in terms of like actual performance. All the feedback that I collected from her from the people was was.

674
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:11.809
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we're consistently, very, very strong. I think her issue is after the Covid leads. Then it's hard for her to find a to to find a project to be staffed on.

675
02:48:14.880 --> 02:48:18.999
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So, Michael, do you see? He's she's staffable.

676
02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:26.230
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think we we tried a lot of a lot of means to to get herself. I mean, even

677
02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:28.779
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: like with some partial buildings.

678
02:48:28.940 --> 02:48:30.530
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, so

679
02:48:33.390 --> 02:48:38.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so. Oh, it's hard to say. But I I think she's getting on the right right now.

680
02:48:39.070 --> 02:48:39.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hmm!

681
02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:55.499
SHI.42.South.06: I think our reason is, of course, is personal. We should expect that, but we need to tell her that her

682
02:48:55.540 --> 02:49:01.859
SHI.42.South.06: it's foul, but might not go very good after, she returned. But that's a choice. I

683
02:49:02.650 --> 02:49:05.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, yeah, she's aware of that.

684
02:49:06.760 --> 02:49:07.730
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

685
02:49:08.490 --> 02:49:24.290
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she's she's she's available now on on on. Well, I would say, the momentum looks good So the upward moment from 4, 3 right now I have like 2,

686
02:49:24.330 --> 02:49:27.830
SHI.42.South.06: but the score wise because it's a cumulative.

687
02:49:27.980 --> 02:49:35.469
SHI.42.South.06: If you look at a score weighted a weighted score. It's it's almost a 3, 2, something like close to 3

688
02:49:36.720 --> 02:49:58.339
SHI.42.South.06: 2.9. So it's not good. So my question is for the fret's leave for what's our criteria to you? If it is really the so, I'll be given to out. Track is okay on track player performers is okay, or are we only given to top group over? If it is top of what this is not, what if it is on track? I would say, this is a, this is one. Right?

689
02:49:58.530 --> 02:50:02.290
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So it yeah. So for flex leave

690
02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:24.880
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If the CD status is on track, I think it's okay. I think the the question to ask is, giving that he her profile right? He she's She's 17 months She's not like a super strong, but I guess it's a. The trajectory is good on track. So whether if she takes the flex leave right now, basically, it will take a pause

691
02:50:24.880 --> 02:50:44.369
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: on her tenure right for 2 months, and the weather. We wait for that one. Wait for her. Come coming back and the resume, you know the staffing. So for some people, if we see clearly no potential or no, you know no way out, I guess so we will not. or the the flex leave

692
02:50:44.370 --> 02:50:54.529
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for her. If we see the, you know. Actually, she's stopable. She's Okay. Maybe we can wait for 2 months. And after she comes back. Yeah.

693
02:50:55.260 --> 02:51:08.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, I I think one thing that's like new to me that she got up for at the first case. But for all the feedback that I actually heard at that took over her. I, DC. Was really positive. So it's not like that. She's

694
02:51:08.280 --> 02:51:13.149
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: like being performing better is like she's consistently performing goods.

695
02:51:13.850 --> 02:51:18.860
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I'm not sure what happened for the first case. Yeah,

696
02:51:19.460 --> 02:51:45.859
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I guess that's that's the past experience. But yeah, current city status is okay. And she's not playing with the real cause. We sometimes receive applications on la to to cut the time. for example.

697
02:51:45.940 --> 02:51:56.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but this one is right after the case stopping. So I guess it's not fragmented. it's not hard hard to do.

698
02:51:57.020 --> 02:52:01.330
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Maybe we should. We should agree on that.

699
02:52:07.950 --> 02:52:11.129
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Just a remember to her that she needs to.

700
02:52:11.170 --> 02:52:15.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the back to the trajectory after the not leaf.

701
02:52:15.990 --> 02:52:18.030
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. Yeah.

702
02:52:18.140 --> 02:52:18.870
Yeah.

703
02:52:19.480 --> 02:52:22.590
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. I think that.

704
02:52:24.110 --> 02:52:33.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. So the decision will be up a proof of both of the black sleeve. do you want to spend maybe 2 more minutes just to

705
02:52:33.620 --> 02:52:36.360
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we have all the decisions for today.

706
02:52:41.210 --> 02:52:46.210
SHI.42.South.06: Yes, please, let's so quickly look at all of these chains and our way

707
02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:49.160
SHI.42.South.06: call it up for that today.

708
02:52:49.330 --> 02:52:51.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay,

709
02:52:57.400 --> 02:53:10.339
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So again, from that promotion 21 months promotion agonously, 21 months charged you 18 month you, you say 15 months something in 15

710
02:53:10.370 --> 02:53:13.079
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 1712 months.

711

BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Jordan, Joe, watch out and Kevin, Jiao ref black.

712
02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:26.050
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If there is no objection, I'll move to next.

713
02:53:26.270 --> 02:53:27.320
SHI.42.South.06: So

714
02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:35.970
SHI.42.South.06: okay, next one. so

715
02:53:36.590 --> 02:53:39.960
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the there's one more reflex for

716
02:53:41.550 --> 02:53:42.980
SHI.42.South.06: good

717
02:53:43.730 --> 02:53:50.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and moving to next, we have a reflex from 4 of almonds and another reflex, for yet in here.

723
02:54:14.810 --> 02:54:21.979

724
02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:28.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and choice. Who is the termination within probation?
