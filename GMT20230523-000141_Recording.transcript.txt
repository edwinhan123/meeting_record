WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.230
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, she always. Yeah, that starts.

2
00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.480
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay.

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:26.569
SHI.42.South.06: So all right, yeah, welcome to the ABC, and we will spend a whole day today to discuss about like 20 or 20 of our 8. So but but before we get into each of them to review, let's look at it. Today's agenda

4
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.740
that?

5
00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.460
SHI.42.South.06: Oh.

6
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:57.320
SHI.42.South.06: yeah. So it was before the reveal. We will have some topics the key topic today. We will also emphasize. Why is the collaboration results, and the other one is the Cdn. Survey on the Cds of it. It's a newly launched initiative since our since last year, so we will share the result, and and then some of the key back

7
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:09.439
SHI.42.South.06: message. Then we'll talk about essay and then associate. So the last of it is the endorsement. which is flexible and Brexit of those who will discuss a few people. Yeah.

8
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.399
SHI.42.South.06: let's go into the management topic.

9
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:38.109
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, again, I know that as as usual, this is all. A discussion today will be super confidential, highly confidential. And then the the process, and then the the Compton to discuss today. please took it to this ABC committee. And then you got this calls until you're informed, though it's an like a doors and a map. Okay.

10
00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.620
SHI.42.South.06: yeah.

11
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.189
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, so

12
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:55.899
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: shall we? shall we invite tag? And that need to give us some overarching guidance on today's toll. And also the criteria.

13
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:07.990
Ted Chan: Okay? Sure. Yeah, let me let me start. first. thank you. Everyone for doing this for the whole day today. is very, very early morning meeting as well.

14
00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:23.259
Ted Chan: so I'm sure all of you would have in mind already. And all this this direction, right? Maybe just a couple of points from me. one is right. we obviously right as usual, right? Wants to maintain a very high standard this year.

15
00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:45.959
Ted Chan: it. It. It should always be the alcohol right to maintain very, very high standard right in the CD meetings. but of course, right? Say, for example, 2, 3 years ago, right when when we are really, really tied on resources. Sometimes we give a little bit of a slack right? but right for this year. Right? We want to continue right again to emphasize this maintaining high standard.

16
00:02:46.040 --> 00:03:04.659
Ted Chan: a. This is not just because of frankly right. people would also ask whether we have any target, right, so to speak, right? how many we that we need to do reflex ct. Whatever this time, and to be very, very frank, right? There's no top-down target at all.

17
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:29.659
Ted Chan: Yeah, I I I even I, right as soon right, Neddy. And I asked you right where the there's any target. And she said, No, right. This is very clear, right? but at the that, on the other hand, right we always have some pre-CD meetings with the different CD chairs before each of the CD meetings. Right? And say, for example, for Adc, right, we had this with Cynthia. And we looked at many of the candidates in many of

18
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.049
the associates, and if we look at it bottom up.

19
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:55.140
Ted Chan: there is indeed, quite some people right? That seems to be very clear, either Ct or a reflex candidates, right? And in some sometimes we tend to yeah, be good people, right? And try to be be be a bit soft right in both our decision and in our communications.

20
00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:20.700
Ted Chan: and we just want to make sure that especially as CD devices right? Your role is a more, a neutral advisor, right to the, to, the, to, the to the associates. Right? It's not about really protecting them overly, right? So that just to maintain high standard, so that we give the enough case experience to those who really are strong and multi-serv it right?

21
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:44.500
Ted Chan: so that's overall. Right? The one thing right? We want to. Right, really maintain high stand it. And yeah, and and especially given stuff, the business, right? So that our people, right, our stronger people, right can get more opportunities to to really get case work rather than we giving the case work to some, we could people right to to really protect them. Right?

22
00:04:44.820 --> 00:05:11.930
Ted Chan: So that's number one number 2 is that I want to emphasize again, right? for all of the CD meetings. It's not about looking at just the numbers right very often. We hear right? sometimes the the CD devices just oversimplify the discussion right from the various CD meetings and said, Oh, okay, you are on reflex because of low bill ability, right?

23
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:26.110
Ted Chan: No availability or whatever, or the up with all or say, for example, downward feedback. yeah, you get calibrated downwards right? Sometimes it's over simplifying the messages. Low billability very often

24
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.339
Ted Chan: is because of people not wanting to stop them

25
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.629
Ted Chan: right or they not. They want. They're not one thing to get on projects.

26
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:48.189
Ted Chan: There's always some reasons. Yeah. I think we need to be direct with them right? Not really just bringing the numbers right In CD meetings. We always have very holistic, right? Quantitative and qualitative discussion.

27
00:05:48.190 --> 00:06:11.689
Ted Chan: Right? So it's a holistic discussion, right of of of of all the attributes. Right? Why, you are not able to get on projects right? How do you write a us, advisor. Right? Help them to think about right how you really reach out to some OP. Pl's right, how you'd be more proactive in Bd, right? and this holistic. A discussion is not just about casework. That's also another point.

28
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:40.860
Ted Chan: I'm sure many of you right? OP. Here. I have heard complaints of feedback from time to time. that. Some of our team members yeah, some as. And C's right. They They work very, very hard on tape work because they thought, this is what matters? And Bd doesn't matter right, but actually right for Bd, you all I think for Bds above a certain number of hours. Right? A review will also be triggered.

29
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:48.280
Ted Chan: Or, on the other hand, if you want really want to give you back to someone right during. Bb, you can do so as well. Right?

30
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:55.109
Ted Chan: so we want to have this holistic discussion people who have poor attitude

31
00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.820
Ted Chan: during Pv. we want to highlight that right during CD discussions as well. It's not just about case work

32
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:23.420
Ted Chan: right? and, for example, we also have seen some people right? having some active issues, right at the 2 issues, right? Not just in work, but also outside of eg, for example representing Pcg, right today. actually, you will here, I think, to to associate

33
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.240
Ted Chan: who have pretty much

34
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:52.569
Ted Chan: pissed off right the Home Marriott hotel chain right, and either the whole case team got kicked out of the hotel, or either he or she him. he's himself. I was kind of banned from the Maria chain. Right? I mean some of those behavior, right? It's not personal behavior, right? You are part of Ecg, when you do this right? So some of that right is, if it's part of a holistic discussion as well.

35
00:07:52.680 --> 00:08:01.139
Ted Chan: Yeah, just want to make sure this is not about numbers. This is not just about looking at availability. Right? It's a very holistic. Which discussion about each of the individuals.

36
00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:10.449
Ted Chan: I think that's pretty much it from me the 2 points. maybe. Let's see. Yeah. Cynthia has anything to add.

37
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.030
SHI.42.South.06: It is

38
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:30.849
SHI.42.South.06: that if you have any inputs on, I think it's well summarize, so I don't have a other like additional like words on this. let's work together to

39
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:47.559
SHI.42.South.06: as in a ceda, I work together to make sure all this like. The reveals that the collaborations are subject objects, and also called both qualitative and a comedy, if considers, and then to which to a line of you.

40
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:58.449
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: maybe just one more reminder of the attendance. I think we have actually did a couple of times right on.

41
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:02.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But overall speaking, this PC attendance is much back in the eighties.

42
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:17.220
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we see a lot of you know, actions we're not able to join in person.

43
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:23.969
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So let's try our best to a head in person. And also I need to say, I would say, online.

44
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.109
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: making the discussion working page.

45
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:33.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. So yes, today, I think we've had a very, very rich discussion on this.

46
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:50.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We hope that we can do the things our ABC. As well. I think maybe he can share with you. Our little survey results later. Obviously, the feedback on our ABC. And also the advisors.

47
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:53.900
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think we we need some clear improvement on that.

48
00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:03.019
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we already see that. you know, we have some development that for so it's a quite important for us to make effort.

49
00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:13.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right, how we move to next.

50
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.690
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So for this year's category, category results for the first half.

51
00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:33.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: first of all, thanks to every Mdp and Pvpl's effort. So we have reached with an average of 2.1 9 for our As and C's, which is also into our target. More than ever.

52
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:39.480
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: However, we still have 15 Mdps listed over there. all that in pink.

53
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:59.900
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So, as mentioned. Starting from this year, we will be very straight on calibration, and for all the sports that are not not well calibrated from yesterday's practice in Cdc, we actually, our treatment is actually automatically done with one for the promotion discussion for these sports.

54
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:21.239
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and etc. So all these potential inflating scores are will be highlighted in pink in background. for on the following pages. So let's all keep this in mind later discussion, and together to enforce the integration further and hopefully, we can get every and the Mdp

55
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:27.369
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: meeting the target during year. And so please do check on the names

56
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:36.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: of those still with scores in pink and sure to remind them, and also remind ourselves that these scores might be inflated

57
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:47.569
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. Moving to the Cda Survey as mentioned.

58
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:56.230
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And many of you may have noticed this year. Most of the city initiative is mainly focused on improving the city process.

59
00:11:56.250 --> 00:12:18.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so from the A/C perspective, it is very, very important that that our city as a channel or or the The only channel for our agencies to get get understanding of their CD decisions is very important to improve the the

60
00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:38.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: transparency to them. So therefore, since that cycle we launched a quarterly survey, we're hoping to improve the communication. We're also helping us to better understand as he's needs for the it a role The survey itself is very simple and very straightforward. Cover a few aspects, many.

61
00:12:38.770 --> 00:13:05.859
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the educational time span, and also the quality of the communication. the CD team will collect the every quarter and provide real-time feedback on some common concerns to me, committee and also we'll provide specific development areas and suggestion to individual cities. So we hope everyone can actively and dive particularly. Listen to these feedback and react to this.

62
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:15.429
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So for the results. as you can see over here. First of all, our response rate is around 55%

63
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:25.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: overall feedback is definitely some premium that expected, and especially not as good as Cdc.

64
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:33.459
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So the pre-called for pre-call and post call we do have some associated indicate that they are amazing necessary communication.

65
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:57.939
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: just want to highlight here that this is the minimum request for all this to be a to communicate with your cva, that your advisees so please do contact all your free calls, and for this call, if you are not contacting, due to advising, not not being discussed in a meeting. Please let them know clearly a hat that you are not being discussed because we do have

66
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:17.079
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: looking for that, I think. Mentioned that. I didn't receive the post call, but I'm not sure if I'm discussed, so I'm not sure if that's right or wrong.  so to care to clarify again? Because I got quite a lot of these questions from the Cdas.

67
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:35.799
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for Q. 2 and Q. For all that, all your other devices would be discussed, and for Q. One q. 3, you can find the to be discussed. List for your list on the kitchen email some by 10. So if you have any questions on that, not clear on that, please reach out to us for help.

68
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:41.879
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Secondly, for the time spent, notice that we have quite a few

69
00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.450
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: cdas.

70
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:59.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: spending very few time talking to your your advisors, especially in post. Call less than 5 min or not through a call face to face. I guessing email. Or we chat this is.

71
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:15.189
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it will be 2025%. And this is very hard to believe how we could deliver a clear message and next step to our advisors, if only talking less about 5 min. So for all the Cdas.

72
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:21.129
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: please do spend more time to get to know your authorities and also clarify next steps

73
00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:31.540
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for communication quality. what we receive a lot here is that, the associates feel

74
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:36.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  not being well known by the the

75
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.930
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the otherwise.

76
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:51.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think. I do do receive a lot of complaints from our associates, saying, I have to reintroduce myself every single time you want to talk to my Cda.

77
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:59.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And they don't really remember my name. They don't remember my location. And not even my PA or things like that.

78
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:04.249
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Please do techniques and get to know your abyss because

79
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:15.189
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: you should be the one, and of them the most, and also we do receive complaints from a associate specifically not consultants associates

80
00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:39.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that. I think my cda is not communicating with my Pbps at all. from what I know from PP house, some may by emails to my Pl to get some reading feedback, some. They're just not no communication. Also, I'm not sure how they how they know how my my performance.

81
00:16:39.810 --> 00:16:42.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So again, please

82
00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:54.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: plaque the information through a call with your advisory Vp else, and maybe sometimes their colleagues to get more holistic view on their performance.

83
00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:09.750
Ted Chan: Now, maybe just a comment. Here, right? I I'm just looking at the time spent right? I think. Say, for example, for the Pre call right? 40% less than 10 min. This, indeed, sounds a bit low. Right?

84
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:22.790
Ted Chan: no matter right. The associates, right they are, staff or not staffed right. But if you talk to them every 3 months, right, or sometimes maybe even 6 months, right? But I hope it's 3 months.

85
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.569
Ted Chan: I'm sure. Right, there is quite some you can talk about right. The

86
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:37.410
Ted Chan: challenges he or she has been facing. Right well, what cases has has she or he been on who he's been working with

87
00:17:37.450 --> 00:18:06.370
Ted Chan: right understanding him or her as an individual right? What is his or her concerns right? If he or she was not on project. Right? It doesn't mean there's nothing to talk about, right? you can still right be talking to them. How to write advice, right, how to write be more proactive in bb, right? what kind of projects you might be interested in, right where I can do anything right to to support you. More. Right? So frankly, I feel 10 min is is

88
00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:13.750
Ted Chan: it's quite little right? And I'm a bit surprised. Right? 40% of the

89
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:24.640
Ted Chan: Yeah, I don't know. Right on average. I think you guys have each right 5 to 6 devices. Right?  so I yeah, I I

90
00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:38.959
Ted Chan: I sincerely hope right? I mean, you can get to. I'm sure many of you have been doing a an excellent job in this right? but for some others right? I hope you can right really try to reduce the opportunity to like

91
00:18:39.000 --> 00:19:04.030
Ted Chan: learn about more in the signals as a person right to talk more right? Try to at least frankly, like 15 min probably not a not a big ask right? But 1520, 30 min. Right I I I personally right do it with my ppl. If I see right every quarter, right? And every time it feels like we can talk the full 30 min

92
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:16.600
Ted Chan: for each of them. Right? So that just make sure right you spend. I know you're all very, very busy, right this I fully fully recognize, but I just hope right. And you have in your mind

93
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:35.610
Ted Chan: right 5, 10 you shouldn't be expecting only 5, 10 min right by out. But I hope you set the but a bit higher. yeah, And and and I'm sure, right, many of our associates with them feel this is a much more helpful. And and yeah, yeah, yeah, useful discussions. Right? Yeah.

94
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:48.959
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think as we mentioned we, we do see very clear that our

95
00:19:49.190 --> 00:20:02.580
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to commitment in terms of how to for our agencies, and also engaged in the meetings. Right? We also see that many people may say, Oh, I have a fine meeting right now. Let me present my

96
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:11.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and the, you know, for the remaining discussion they may not be able to engage. I think you know every committee ourselves in the

97
00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:17.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: let's try to at least and spend, you know, focus today on the full discussion.

98
00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:45.510
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's also showing the respect for our people and investing our people. We know that every one of you are very easy. you may have some urgent headlines, a lot of things to prioritize on. This is really important. But if we we do not, you guys being our people, I think it gradually, you know, we see issues on the A/C development and also our culture. So let's try our best to improve on this especially for

99
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right moving to next section.

100
00:20:52.980 --> 00:21:08.059
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So just few points on the work, the app days might be useful for all our Cds. First, we have the updated more information, outlook, notification, especially for dos here in every everything. So why, you see the email like this, please?

101
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:20.279
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I do click on and finish what what is left, on what day. And secondly, we have updated auto safe, not only on down more feedback, but also do here. So that would be more helpful.

102
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:46.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And next one is the self service off on download feedback. So you can click one button to get a Pdf E or email to right for downward feedback. this is very useful when you are losing Internet, and or maybe in the middle of meeting, or something like that. So please do utilize this function. And lastly, is that Mdps are able to add it

103
00:21:46.870 --> 00:22:00.280
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and make simple score change, or come and change not just to get this back to Ppl. But you could actually add it by yourself. If that's more convenient.

104
00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:10.429
Ivy Wu: all right. Next session, I'll leave that to Ib to introduce some and the resources. Can you hear me?

105
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:25.160
Ivy Wu: Yes, okay, great. So I'll have a very quick update about the training programs this year, especially highlight. The new lateral hire booster target to lateral higher in C

106
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:53.729
Ivy Wu: and all the as you can see, all the sessions are lap out with our evaluation, so you can very easily find your vices afd, and provide related mechanism support. And if you so, this sheet is simply for your reference. So you can understand how your advice is training schedule, and also provided related support when needed.

107
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:55.629
Ivy Wu: and next, please.

108
00:22:56.050 --> 00:23:25.870
Ivy Wu: So lastly, we also have some new learning workshop Bi weekly on Friday noon. So we provide a lot of the essential consulting skills and learn with their peer groups. So if you found, if you found your vices had the related needs, please encourage them to join that they can also learn a lot of the PA knowledge and latest sharing from the topic gurus, which are a Ppl.

109
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.689
Ivy Wu: Okay, thank you.

110
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:36.080
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright. Next I I'll invite. So that to introduce our new Evp initiative on capital.

111
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:54.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah,

112
00:23:54.440 --> 00:24:14.989
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And the main target for this initiative is to bring parity up to our ancestors on all the existing. We are options. We have. so that we can help them to make a more structure. so there's no

113
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:26.589
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: essentially so it's more like a restructure. And so it's it's

114
00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:52.859
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so. there are 3 key components within this

115
00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:54.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then

116
00:24:54.060 --> 00:25:00.069
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: along the way, they can also have multiple.

117
00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:11.880
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. So we also take a typical journey for Anc to navigate through their career opportunities. I want that into detail, but we want to at the side of it.

118
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:31.100
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So when you talk with your

119
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:43.550
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and these do manage their

120
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:51.369
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the A case by case decision based on the review of the cooler factory. So not everyone will.

121
00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:54.819
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm guaranteed to be to to be yours.

122
00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:23.860
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We do have a lot of resources. If you want more more details, so you can check on the password platform, or you can read our Cda reference that and send along with yesterday's announcement email, so we actually focus more on the

123
00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:46.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I know there's a lot of email. So we are not. But we will have a workshop with the Anc's next Friday, so we will introduce only speak up to them. So we're not we created, and we are not expecting all the video to understand, but that in very video. But our key app here is to next week.

124
00:26:47.080 --> 00:27:13.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so on here is to this in corporate the pathway discussion into your.

125
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:38.129
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for instance.

126
00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:48.389
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so the global is also developing the upgrading. Yeah, it's sort of

127
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:55.329
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: as a tool to

128
00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.080
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So

129
00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:21.509
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: in summary

130
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:29.989
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so we will do it in a to sort of as a test one. So you can start to have a better understanding of the pathway.

131
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:46.280
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And

132
00:28:46.280 --> 00:29:01.449
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and lastly, if you're like the already they already participated in any of the electives. we used to help us to collapse and see the fact, the evaluation, especially for those.

133
00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:05.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, thank you.

134
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:14.020
Ted Chan: Maybe just very quickly. I actually get that question offline. So maybe I just address it here.

135
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:27.839
Ted Chan: Okay, just just to make it clear. We do. look at the performance of our CD advisors regularly either month a yearly right? If not by annually.

136
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:35.080
Ted Chan: And it is a big group. So you might not realize. But we do rotate out

137
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:49.650
Ted Chan: on average, maybe one to 2 advisors of the Cdc's and 80 right? And sometimes when the advisors are clearly not performing

138
00:29:49.710 --> 00:30:13.320
Ted Chan: in terms of either attendance, or say, for example, feedback, yeah. from the A, by C, yeah, sometimes is through the A surveys. Right? Sometimes we heard very consistent right? Of course we do not do it easily, right? but there are some advisors, right? Yeah. You might or might not los this right. They they actually, repeatedly

139
00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:32.060
Ted Chan: right. Got kind of complained by the advice, right? Not doing the job, not doing the communications right, not participating in meetings right? Poor attendance. We do rotate out as as of now. We don't do that that often, frankly right. But on average, there's one to 2 per committee

140
00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:47.840
Ted Chan: that got some cases out So I just want to make sure. Right? that's because, right, there's question right, how do we deal with devices that that that are not really doing the job. And I just want to. Right, make it clear here. Okay.

141
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.869
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. Thank you. Ta, so shall we start the discussion from essay promotion?

142
00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.520
SHI.42.South.06: Yes.

143
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.130
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right. First one, I call it John Crystal.

144
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:29.090
Crystal Hao: Yeah. Sorry we had discussed his situation last time. I think. there's no big changes he finished the the the auto projects. And now guide him to another pis project so overall his availability in last 12 months is 60%

145
00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:38.980
Crystal Hao: as I remember. So basically and to end project since last year.

146
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:53.780
Crystal Hao: And the the performance for reason to for 4 projects. is all about like 2. So it's over a consistent performance in last 4 projects.

147
00:31:53.890 --> 00:32:18.070
Crystal Hao: I think the the feedback also, quite consistent his strength is in, you know. Could understand class problem. very good, that relationship beauty and also it's very efficient to produce the the project output.

148
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:47.140
Crystal Hao: I think. from this. the auto projects is, actually, implementation type of project to implement, the strategy planning process. So in addition to the the planning site We also learned to how to push clients to make the internal alignment, and actually launch the process

149
00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:55.410
Crystal Hao: build up the internal capability. So I I think for this. The Ppl. Give him the the feedback one

150
00:32:55.410 --> 00:33:19.749
Crystal Hao: nice that next level to consultants he need to be you know, and to and on the module not only he's used to and that to to the planning setup work but also make sure the implementation and the drive the the real client impact.

151
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:38.310
Crystal Hao: So I think is a fair you know comments to from I say to or to see and also, there is no feedback to for him to to to move to next career stack.

152
00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:50.519
Crystal Hao: So overall, I think we we had the the vote last time. I'm still keep the say, a similar recommendation for promotion at

153
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.370
Crystal Hao: 21 months is, yeah.

154
00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:16.450
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. thanks. Crystal. So yeah, I recall that we did the vote for call it last time for 1821. And it's very tied for that one. And I I think from both the how many

155
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:25.619
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: matrices? All me, 21 months criteria. So shall we make the decision for 21 month promotion?

156
00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:31.209
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Can we look at the

157
00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:45.880
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. That last time we talked about his in the borderline for

158
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:52.639
Crystal Hao: 18 to 21, I think 21 months is his

159
00:34:53.130 --> 00:35:04.900
Crystal Hao: rotate average is 1.8 and the one year availability 60. So it should be well for in 2 days. cohort.

160
00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:10.840
SHI.42.South.06: Yes.

161
00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:16.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: what? Let's Jeffrey.

162
00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:31.140
Jeffrey Gao: yeah. And it's I think she also worked on the the auto case. I talked with the Pm. actually, she is doing well. that she is able to manage her the module by herself.

163
00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:45.080
Jeffrey Gao: and also, a very good client action. So last time we said, it's she really needs to get a chances to interact with the client. But during this face, actually, she is doing great

164
00:35:45.100 --> 00:36:04.530
Jeffrey Gao: regarding the client touchings and also I ask the the Pm. Regarding whether she is really to be promoted to condolence. and also willing to staff her as a consultant. The answer is, yes, yes. So Looking at also the the score. Wise, right? I think she is.

165
00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:22.779
Jeffrey Gao: kind of 21 months is a case. but her availability is surprising, Lola. I know she was working on that. It'd be also starting late last year. just tell me, but that's her credibility is quite low. I don't know what's the case about that. So

166
00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:29.910
Jeffrey Gao: but otherwise, I think, regarding the case feedback, and also the evaluation. She says, 21 months cases.

167
00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:40.640
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: The reason why she's a bit of a client available here. So it was because, she was not staff on Facebook

168
00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:52.020
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for for quite a long time. So that was why we decided to make some special financial treatment like partially discounted her for billing so that it was fine.

169
00:36:52.670 --> 00:37:06.099
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, to add on that so I can say, look on some of the local cheer ones. that would definitely be a hard and also adding,

170
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:23.319
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the auto I've checked with Kay, and he could maybe present as well this, mainly because the case budgeting. And if there is, or her maybe, Kate, could you please?

171
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.050
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Awesome.

172
00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:44.290
Kay Tang: Yeah. Just to build on that. I think Agnes is doing quite well on the case. And basically, for the second half of the case, I didn't really, you know, paid to too much attention now, Agnes Mojo. So he's he's doing her own module on her own interacting a lot interacting with a lot of the clients.

173
00:37:44.290 --> 00:38:08.420
Kay Tang: I think the majority and also the content. Wise She's ready for promotion, and also Michael was direct. we got Agnes, because previously Agnes's availability is lower. And then she got on, the more she got on the case, and we decided to staff her for about 6 to 8 weeks or so. but we can only give her 50% availability.

174
00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:28.740
Kay Tang: and afterwards, because of her a good performance, we decided to extend her staffing on the case. But still The budget cannot afford and then we sort of strike the arrangement that she she's gonna stay on the case, given the a slow pipeline. But you know the availability is kind of legging behind. So that is why

175
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:51.290
Rina Su: I don't know.

176
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:53.000
Rina Su: Thank you.

177
00:38:53.070 --> 00:39:00.299
SHI.42.South.06: It's great. It's not very clear that

178
00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:04.880
Rina Su: it's not just me.

179
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.170
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Maybe maybe you want to. Yeah, maybe

180
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:25.939
SHI.42.South.06: the score recent score looks indeed actually good. the key issues when I look at accumulated powers.

181
00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:46.569
SHI.42.South.06: it's a bit low, which is the once you're in line with the availability issue. It's just for right, but accumulated on ours. Let me remind everyone it. It counts the local tier. One global here. Well, these ours are all common in so humility of our system, high enough.

182
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.030
SHI.42.South.06: which means like

183
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:57.180
SHI.42.South.06: learning through those like cases. No matter. It's case that the Ti was.

184
00:39:57.210 --> 00:40:03.140
SHI.42.South.06: it's lower than the others. So if we compare with the

185
00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.470
SHI.42.South.06: for example. we just decided 21.

186
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.640
Rina Su: Okay.

187
00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Still. right now.

188
00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:47.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, maybe T, can we move to the the collaboration page because we have the cumulative hours in the past on that page. So we can cab that. But

189
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:59.429
Lin An: I think what we now just said is 20% availability probably cannot consider

190
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:06.390
Lin An: as the fast promotion, especially, I think we don't have a history of promoting someone who is still under investment

191
00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:17.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and compared to Corey. Indeed, it's a

192
00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:23.940
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If we

193
00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:41.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  did she join us with 10 you could. I can remember.

194
00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.409
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: No. she join us as fresh as a

195
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.460
Jeffrey Gao: okay.

196
00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:48.700
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So

197
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:55.459
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so if we are not making a promotion discussion, then we'll it. That will be

198
00:41:55.910 --> 00:42:01.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: a referendum, because this is an apple out discussion for next time.

199
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: An email. Right?

200
00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:10.530
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's not fast promotion.

201
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: no discussion.

202
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:35.240
Ted Chan: And frankly right. I've worked with Alex that Agnes. Since her first case, I do feel she actually is quite strong, and I mean capabilities. Why, she has been on she's been doing some kind of consulting more Cns related right? But I I I think we're

203
00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:55.130
Ted Chan: analytical person, right? So I'm a bit surprised about her staffing. Right? So yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, it's a yeah. I know it's a yeah above decision right next time. But Michael, maybe let's let's try to see if yeah. yeah, I mean, I don't. I? I actually, I'm not sure why she has not

204
00:42:55.450 --> 00:43:00.510
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: being like able to find a opportunity.

205
00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:16.509
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I mean, in the first year of of her tenure, I mean, she has all just been only doing some kind of t one works, and there was a well, partly because of the slower pipeline, but it it it was still a little bit pricing to me as well.

206
00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:29.740
SHI.42.South.06: I also just would put it in on 24 like next time, like a discussion. So no need to just make a decision right now.

207
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:59.189
SHI.42.South.06: Based on the availability, very low-piece availability, and also the low cumulative hours. So if you wait this time in the calibration, chart, if you look at that, we put cumulative hours on that as a reference as well. So unless it's 24 to 12, unless it's 12 months Like a faster track, which is A 1,000 something a thousand 500 around the like a cumulative hours, all the others 250

208
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:28.099
SHI.42.South.06: promoted. roughly like, it's about a hundred 1,800 to 2 like 2,000, plus that typing for accumulative hours. So obviously in terms of accumulative hours definitely. I think it's not not enough for hours to to develop for herself. yet! So let's wait till next time to see! And then Like a staffing. Our second team! Please take a

209
00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:40.260
SHI.42.South.06: a couple look after this other. A a to see if there's some hours that can give it to to her to for for her to develop.

210
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:53.470
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, so I I have 2 things to make it clarified for Agnes first. technically, if she is not promoted. Now, then, we have to put her on a reflex.

211
00:44:53.780 --> 00:45:06.429
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because next time is up or out. Technically, we have to do this. So that would be a reflect discussion. And secondly, what we what do we need that admin to do in order to promote next time, because.

212
00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:17.239
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: honestly there's only 3 months left well, maybe actually, for for her would be yeah 3 months left. And

213
00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:20.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I don't think her philosophy would

214
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:24.059
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: be as high as others, even after 3 months

215
00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:28.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also for cumulative hours. So what what's our

216
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:32.559
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: what's our view? What was our ask for Agnes?

217
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:52.349
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: No, she she's just. I think she just rolled off. But but I think we are trying to pull her every Denison. But that's still fully available. So, still depending on judge or chose decision.

218
00:45:54.040 --> 00:46:04.040
Lin An: I mean, if we look at the current bill is 20 something, even after 3 months. I think the number will now go very high. Maybe you should deliver the message to

219
00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:10.499
Lin An:  to this associate. You know, she needs really needs to pay attention to the, to the availability.

220
00:46:11.950 --> 00:46:22.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I mean, yes, and also for minutes. Next time we can look at accumulative hours, and also the school. So if the school continues to be strong, right so with one, and choose

221
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:42.600
SHI.42.South.06: In terms of The high level of in terms of the same like integrated scores, and also the subscribers. that's one and the other one is cumulative hours and like 3 months before you you have. if it, if I account for 3 months, means 400 h.

222
00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:51.169
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so are we. Are we saying that

223
00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:58.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: first she will get him. She need to get another case fully available right, and then get a good score

224
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:01.949
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: was sufficient. Maybe another

225
00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:07.339
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 2 or 300 h that would make a promotion decision right?

226
00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:30.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But we we all hear the feedback. Right? She said.

227
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:39.190
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Fullness. She's actually quite good So let's try to make before in the

228
00:47:41.350 --> 00:47:49.859
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright. So, Michael, let's pay close attention to make sure. She says, Okay, and we'll put her on Ref for now

229
00:47:50.150 --> 00:48:08.789
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and next one in terms of communication. Geoffrey. I think you know there are many reasons to find it right. of course she herself needs to to make more effort on that. but I guess let's not, you know

230
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:14.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: on that, I think.

231
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:25.119
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright. Shall we move to the next one?

232
00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:26.880
Allen Zhang: I'm sure.

233
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:56.110
Allen Zhang: sorry. in the recent case. I think she's doing quite well continues strong performance. she was on a a a Pmo case. so quite complicated. there's 60 more in our client to manage, and a very complicated stakeholder and team setup. And he did a she did a good job and she got a 2 So overall look at Sherry's performance, I think

234
00:48:56.110 --> 00:49:03.299
Allen Zhang: over all her performance. Quite stable. So she is a strong

235
00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:19.949
Allen Zhang: and effective and efficient in in, in delivery, on time. And she is a good in presentation. And she that the previous feedback she is a little bit Neither did more practice in terms of climbing management, and I think she proved

236
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:43.259
Allen Zhang: at 12 in. In the recent Pmo case. so oval for for performance is quite strong. and a good trajectory right? She never get a free. She's a 2 plus performance along the way in his in her tenure and I would like to propose an 18 months of promotion.

237
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.169
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We don't have a substance.

238
00:49:54.290 --> 00:49:55.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh.

239
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:30.279
SHI.42.South.06: and so Sherry worked with me on the amplified case. she has a strong on the ship very self motivates to drive her own module. independently. so I I do feel that I also worked with her on a few other cases. A few months ago. I I do see I should have very consistent good performance over it. And so

240
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:44.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so in terms of the

241
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:54.130
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: right.

242
00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:11.769
SHI.42.South.06: I think this is. Yeah, this looks at 18 spine. So the overall scores and also the fish that

243
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:13.210
SHI.42.South.06: what I hurt

244
00:51:14.450 --> 00:51:24.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: just to remind everyone the score with pink background would be the potentially inflated score.

245
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:53.150
SHI.42.South.06: On this anal. I just noticed that the cumulative hours for sharing sherry also. Not high enough.

246
00:51:58.330 --> 00:52:01.519
Allen Zhang: yes, I think.

247
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:10.270
Allen Zhang: yeah, I think her. Her case availability is it's it's quite okay. Right? It's 49.

248
00:52:10.350 --> 00:52:15.980
Allen Zhang:  yeah.

249
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:26.829
SHI.42.South.06: But if we look at the profile of a previous S. H. And C. Promotion. It's used to herb, and a lot of it's unwatered, or even 15 months ago.

250
00:52:28.270 --> 00:52:30.660
SHI.42.South.06: Some of this hard involvement

251
00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:33.359
SHI.42.South.06: to look at the

252
00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:35.439
SHI.42.South.06: oh, the chat record

253
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:44.220
SHI.42.South.06: on stream

254
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:51.930
SHI.42.South.06: which she's about.

255
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:03.350
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It was a review for 18 months, promotion a week supportive, or

256
00:53:12.050 --> 00:53:12.750
SHI.42.South.06: this.

257
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:29.209
Allen Zhang: I think, in terms of school. All right. shared Sherry's exports, but high and very I think, a good trajectory right? And talk to pr I think she is ready for for for promotion.

258
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:57.420
Allen Zhang: and and I think we we can give her some credit on that, and but going forward remind her on the unavailability. But I think she is kind of looking for other cases for the the cases outside healthcare to in terms of vulnerability. So maybe that's the one of factor. She got a little bit lower availability. But I I think she's quite staffable right in terms of I don't think that's a a big issue for her.

259
00:53:57.460 --> 00:54:04.139
Allen Zhang: So if it's okay, I think I would also support her her 18 months promotion.

260
00:54:11.840 --> 00:54:17.050
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. So from the trajectory, I'll I'll have to say that

261
00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:26.120
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I have a question on the the one I was just quite influenced by. it's his home score.

262
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:32.409
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And if I recall that correctly, or it's a 2 or 3 from a pl.

263
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:39.479
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then calibrated by she's home to one. But yes, he didn't meet the

264
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:48.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: hi version call  but it's almost like we can only a 2 or 3 from the Pl. You mean.

265
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.679
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes, if I didn't recall that wrong.

266
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:57.309
Ted Chan: and there's no subscribers in the evaluation at all.

267
00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:00.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because because he didn't submit that.

268
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:09.390
SHI.42.South.06: So you mean previously it's a 3, and then, however, it to one, or at least a low 2.

269
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:15.499
SHI.42.South.06: Why, there is such an a big difference during calibration.

270
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:23.700
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. The reviewer was his own himself. And

271
00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:28.129
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think he made decision originally to give a to

272
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:34.109
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: maybe or 3. I I didn't recall, and then move to a one after knowing

273
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.129
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this promotion window

274
00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:43.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: like. For the

275
00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:52.200
SHI.42.South.06: so in most office cases there usually be some score dissertation. This is not their home office.

276
00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.240
SHI.42.South.06: Yes.

277
00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:09.179
SHI.42.South.06: so this is a cross-office. Tdd, and So maybe she don't feel that. that is usually and or underrated. Because of the cross-corry system

278
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:14.200
pressure for us, because a lot of times for us office scoring

279
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:20.020
SHI.42.South.06: the team, not at least not from the original office that it lowers for.

280
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:28.079
SHI.42.South.06: because they might also want to calibrate or give a higher school for their home office team.

281
00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:38.099
SHI.42.South.06: I'm not sure if that's the case. But oh, okay, yeah, it's a neutralizing for a calculation, because of the

282
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:39.440
SHI.42.South.06: yeah.

283
00:56:39.850 --> 00:56:49.889
SHI.42.South.06: I suggest for the park here. And then we move on. And I say, I, I will ask to teach them what? So what? What? What has? What's going on on this number? Why, okay.

284
00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:57.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, what's the next one. Then, oh, yeah.

285
00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:27.529
Mengya Lin: okay. So we we have discussed the salary in Last City cycle. So we all agree that she's a very strong, humble. A last time we specifically emphasize her questions, which is the Contractual conceptual thinking and we also notice that she has been working with the yeah. Phi for for a while. So we suggest that she need to

286
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:41.170
Mengya Lin: keep stuffed in case sense to improve her cumulative hours as well as her capability her availability. So in this cycle we can see that her year to day

287
00:57:41.220 --> 00:58:10.319
Mengya Lin: availability has been increased a lot, and also we have, received consistently give us from the case leaders so or all of her all k scores are choose, but we can see that across all those dimensions it has been she has received several ones, especially in the program solving part.

288
00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:29.959
Mengya Lin: and also the the PP, our specifically emphasized that she has improved a lot in terms of kind of communication she's now being able to 5 back with the client, especially in the top situation, and she is now independently

289
00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:42.029
Mengya Lin: working on the Pm, all process. this week. She's also taking all of the 60 of the co presentation. So

290
00:58:42.030 --> 00:59:07.069
Mengya Lin: over on the PP, I think her conceptual thinking and the kind of communication the 2 points. We need to highlight on things last cycle. so we think that she's So last time with the she's tentatively to 15 months promotion. And I think maybe at this time we can confirm this.

291
00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:24.739
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: looking at the scores and consistently to and

292
00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:38.219
Mengya Lin: yeah, pretty stable. And actually, she is quite, quite stable. I've heard that even after her current case, that there is one case waiting for her.

293
00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:44.619
Mengya Lin: So I feel. She has demonstrated her potential and capability.

294
00:59:51.550 --> 01:00:01.550
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. which is

295
01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:07.580
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I? And even sherry that one is.

296
01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:09.450
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and the

297
01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:12.460
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the ours.

298
01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:21.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh.

299
01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.220
Mengya Lin: so what's your question?

300
01:00:27.340 --> 01:00:32.590
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I was asking why? The

301
01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:40.509
Mengya Lin: yes, she she has worked with. h, I for some while.

302
01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:48.250
Ted Chan: Yeah. So yeah, we're saying that. That's why our our worst is, E is low as well. Right?

303
01:00:52.900 --> 01:01:01.740
Mengya Lin: Yeah. But still on par with peers and for

304
01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  looks like more like a

305
01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:35.849
Rina Su: yeah. Yeah. Oh, great. Look at the scores. I think her profile is really look like a 18 months not not capable for 1215 months.

306
01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:44.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. I think for 7 she used to do more case work.

307
01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:51.799
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So a few more experience, and hopefully could get a one next time to confirm

308
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:58.360
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 18 months, but maybe to also work. But she just need more time, more time, more to experience.

309
01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:02.860
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So

310
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:04.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: like, this is my cycle.

311
01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

312
01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:19.959
Kay Tang: sorry. Sorry to interrupt. But if you look at the one sherry versus Agnes. I think the the trajectory of Agnes is is quite strong.

313
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:34.230
Kay Tang: I think we we decided to put her on red flag. compared with Sharon Jav. And I think the is that a bit too hard for her? because the availability is kind of pretty decided before she got on the auto

314
01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:42.169
Kay Tang: and she, her performance is good. So if we deliver the message to put her on reflex, there's basically nothing we can do.

315
01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:45.379
Kay Tang: I I I mean, every

316
01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:47.779
Kay Tang: pretty much. The decision has been made.

317
01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:53.639
Kay Tang: you know, regarding the red flags like couple of months ago. So is there anything we can do before that.

318
01:02:59.910 --> 01:03:03.079
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, I think that's a

319
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:20.250
SHI.42.South.06: calculated. If the auto pays 50%. Staffing understood at the time, it's because of whatever. But it issues. And there's an alignment of 50%. If there's content as a hundred of what the what the humility of our works and availability would be

320
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:23.429
SHI.42.South.06: okay, and that we we call back.

321
01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.450
Kay Tang: Yes, sure

322
01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:37.049
SHI.42.South.06: the can I clarify if the the late and hours I came to all all the investment hours and the working hours with Bhi

323
01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.009
SHI.42.South.06: for a talent.

324
01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:57.470
SHI.42.South.06: or it only take into account the client the ability.

325
01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:07.310
SHI.42.South.06: then it's the accumulated hours full at this is in deep, low compared with the other candidates.

326
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:08.480
SHI.42.South.06: It

327
01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:13.869
SHI.42.South.06: it it already cut it into. You know, the investment hours.

328
01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:24.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. And also for that. And Bhi's. Ours is also comfort in cumulative hours.

329
01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:41.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright we'll we'll call it Agnes data. And that's hybrid that

330
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:44.679
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: let's move to a phone call

331
01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:46.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for the champ.

332
01:04:46.880 --> 01:05:08.450
David Chan: All right. Yeah. So for Frank. So I think, last time we have discussed about Frank. And then, like he actually realized that the ability is actually a relatively low for him, and because that he has actually taken the the low business, then he take a 2, a very long block leaf that makes him a little bit

333
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:32.729
David Chan: and relatively have to actually staff because of the case continuity users. But then I I think after that he actually used up his annual leave. Then he have been actually, very actively find a case to get himself stopped. And so that's why. Since then he has been stopped on 2 cases one is a like the S. Cbx. And another one is due diligence in the us.

334
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:40.469
I think both of the case here has the extremely great feedback from both the people here, actually, where we're working with him.

335
01:05:40.470 --> 01:06:04.659
David Chan: and then, like what they mentioned is that he excelled in all dimension. He actually have a very great problem solving, and are able to actually do good, framing and structuring to soft and be a big risk problem. And also he come in. The came very well that he is able to articulate the message very clearly, and he very independently and in a very extremely high pressure case. So I think of comments, for

336
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:29.630
David Chan: from the Pppo actually mentioned that, like the X, for example, one thing one to highlight is that even for a Us. Case by the Ppo actually work with the team based in the Us. And the from is actually the only one based in Gc. Working remotely with the with the Ppv. And then the at the at the Pl. Mentioned that he is actually the strongest amount of him, actually even including the most people in the

337
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:54.580
David Chan: in the in the Us. Based team. And then he is already performing like a see already. So I think these are some indication from a performance and from absolute performance. Wise. I think he is actually like a already very ready to be promoted, and then, or very actually strongly accepted by the Pvp. Are actually work with him. I think the only thing that like that we need to actually like a hard

338
01:06:54.580 --> 01:07:02.689
like, for discussion is about the cumulative hour is extremely low. But then, like I was trying to look back into some of the previous data.

339
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:26.919
David Chan: But I to see if this actually makes sense, because, last cycle in the P. One, a. DC Frank, one cumulative hour is actually in like 982. And but then, I think since then he has been stuck on these 2 different cases. So I think at least the cumulative weeks shall be roughly like a 9 to 10 weeks, so it will if we incorporate, if the last data is actually

340
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:49.140
David Chan: correct, and then also these 2 data pond is that shall be like a recorded correctly, then I think his cumulative hours shall be 1,400. Roughly, yeah, yeah, I just back to back up the envelope calculations here. So I think, like, what we need to discuss here is that like from an absolute performance. 5. He's indeed actually great.

341
01:07:49.140 --> 01:08:18.149
David Chan: and then I think, cumulative powers right is indeed very low. But then I think rather, we need to. Actually, we look at the data because I you did see some of the discrepancy here. And then if it is in this, finally, that 1,000 is the hours that maybe it is very hard for us to actually justify for a 15 month promotion. But then, if it is actually a shall be correctly refunded. That shall be like a 1,400. And then, looking at the calibration, I think it seems to be decent to be a like 15 month case.

342
01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:34.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. So for so on the cumulative hours. that's times hours 900, something is counted the

343
01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:42.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the the a the scoring the hours in in his

344
01:08:42.870 --> 01:09:04.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: a period So from a a to essay promotion, there's a there's a case hour a split it so last time that that a period is counted. this time we correct the dive data moving that part which means the total amount of hours in that is actually a thousand. That's the main reason.

345
01:09:04.790 --> 01:09:16.310
David Chan: Oh, okay. So you mean, like, the last time the the the community of hours was over estimated, and this this time it has been adjusted more correctly.

346
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:24.219
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes, yes, And last time that that case is Lvmh, which is the the

347
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:26.990
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: what?

348
01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:27.899
David Chan: Hmm!

349
01:09:29.670 --> 01:09:36.459
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So so for Frank, I guess it is the cumulative hour, and also

350
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:47.309
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: still not sufficient, and but a good trajectory, and the performance as recognized. So maybe he could work on more cases.

351
01:09:48.590 --> 01:10:08.409
David Chan: Yeah. And this one, I think, I agree with you, it might be if we actually take into account the cumulative hours. It will be very hard for us to justify 15 months promotion. But I think, what's What can he, or what can we do to actually support Fram? Given like he. He has a good trajectory here.

352
01:10:08.410 --> 01:10:22.289
David Chan: like right now, is he being able to staff from a staffing perspective. I think one key is that he really need to to have the some staffing opportunity for him to actually he's

353
01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:28.809
yeah, well, I think we we we

354
01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:45.360
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think that is apparently We haven't got any negative about about him. the the issue is still with the the relatively still of Hong Kong. right, I think I

355
01:10:45.530 --> 01:10:56.620
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm not sure whether he he is flexible about coming to to the main mainland to do projects. And and also, I mean, given the the, the.

356
01:10:56.620 --> 01:11:16.599
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: basically the separation for the past 3 years. So there there was a some kind of gap of familiarity with Hong Kong agencies from I mean the the main Embassy Ops, so that that that's to the difficulty of stacking him email and traces. But

357
01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:20.860
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but I mean, we will see. We will try and see. Yeah.

358
01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:46.639
David Chan: yeah, I I think just just a little bit of the promotion of all for the branch here, because I think he's Chinese. Capability is super strong as well. I think he'd previously also have done with like a Chinese case with sushi in Hong Kong here. And then the feedback was also very, very great and very strong. So I think if there is any doubt in terms of his China's Kevin Brid here, I think that is not an issue at all. And then I. I also talk to friend, and then he is

359
01:11:46.710 --> 01:12:11.510
David Chan: very eager to be troubled around, like even into Main and China as well. So I think in terms of the willingness. I think he he's really. But then I think he's the only thing is that like how can we actually support him to make him successful before the next city cycle, because, like looking at his performance score, I think it is very short, and then he's staffable at all right. But then, if it is because of the business, slow down that

360
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:15.979
David Chan: like I think it will be quite a like

361
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:24.350
David Chan: either. Unfair. But but and and also maybe some the tragic for for for Frank to be a to be the latest promotion.

362
01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:36.410
Rina Su: I I I I I will say, actually, this is the we should take that factory in to be honest, because the business still up, because we don't have an availability, we are evaluating them, because for the past

363
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:41.680
Rina Su: previous performance availability rather than the future availability. That's my 2 cents

364
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:47.099
Lin An: agree. I think the situation is the same for all the all this, as I say.

365
01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:54.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh.

366
01:12:58.380 --> 01:12:59.390
SHI.42.South.06: oh.

367
01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:11.650
SHI.42.South.06: it's first for the conclusion that I've so I think it's given the ability it it's it's not in media to like 15 small space.

368
01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:14.159
SHI.42.South.06: So to

369
01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:28.139
SHI.42.South.06: which is the great eighteenth So that's what I'm hopefully in terms of availability. The colour is so can tend to slack. And then it's not that

370
01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:43.740
SHI.42.South.06: considering both the the like a total availability and also case availability. So it's a hard boss to justify, promote someone who's availability. They're still like, 1420

371
01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.730
SHI.42.South.06: the correct there.

372
01:13:54.910 --> 01:14:04.890
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright, so we'll decide for. And hopefully you could get stuffed.

373
01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:09.559
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's why we yeah, let me say, Alan.

374
01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:16.279
Allen Zhang: I think. he's a star, I think

375
01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:38.949
Allen Zhang: a very outstanding performance consistent ones. she has got 2 recent feedbacks at the I think the pls are really likes him, and he was the backbone of the cases. I think he is super, strong in problem solving, and not only an a analysis, but also pushed beyond it

376
01:14:38.950 --> 01:15:04.259
Allen Zhang: to to to the obvious almost like a a strong seat profile in terms of problem solving. But and he is also that present place in line direction and a quite effective in in case. delivery so, and he has so super high. ability and good trajectory. So I think he is a clear 15 month. promotion profile.

377
01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:15.289
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I'm looking at the course, and also it will be all very high So we support a 50 month motion.

378
01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:37.249
Crystal Hao: yeah, if they worked on my 2 projects one is the the Chanel. He worked actually very independent module with the the the Cfo and the handle. All the clients you know the interaction very well as he. He's only was one on this module

379
01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:45.790
Crystal Hao: So I was very surprised, because it's the first project I I walked with him, and he almost

380
01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:58.090
Crystal Hao: not almost, I think he performed as a very strong say, in terms of you know, the maturity client interaction content, did you? Or I'll try by himself.

381
01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:14.949
Crystal Hao: and the second one is the the the 0 project. He got stopped the in the meat of the project. As you know, we kind of enough verify it in situation for this project because of the the scope definition

382
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:36.689
Crystal Hao: but he also, you know, handle a module very well to drive the and basically finish some of the the scope. you know, a very, very challenge for normal projects. So I I can't remember what's our discussion last time.

383
01:16:36.690 --> 01:16:51.829
Crystal Hao: but in my you know, experience working with a he actually, I think, in a very high, you know, performance bar and the kind of bill into the 12 months promotion.

384
01:16:53.490 --> 01:17:13.460
Nicholas Ge: I I I don't need to raise the crystal a lot. Honestly, I I think if they is over qualified for 15 months promotion, if you compare his trajectory and the the performance. I mean both the the, the the ratings, and that the availability every he all perform all those

385
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:16.489
Nicholas Ge: 15 months profile. We just had discussed the right.

386
01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:23.289
Nicholas Ge: So I I I I I also want to with the

387
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:36.730
Nicholas Ge: Travis as as the crystal. Just that that he excelled across all dimensions. I don't want to to repeat all those that Google works again, but he is definitely the stop performer we need to recognize.

388
01:17:36.820 --> 01:17:38.189
Nicholas Ge: Yeah. So

389
01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:46.139
Nicholas Ge: yeah, I I I I I think we needed to find a way to recognize and and and and keep this type of Taylor with us.

390
01:17:47.710 --> 01:17:59.770
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, this, to me, seems to be a clear good team with the score consistent one and also very high availability in in in today's like market.

391
01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:03.280
SHI.42.South.06: So I would just say, it's not 50, hey?

392
01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:29.379
Chenao Yu: okay, we. We've discussed meaning in last cycle thinking about early promotion the like due to the scalls. It's a little bit on the bottom line. So we defer to this cycle to the side. I chaded with her reason project Dylan. I think that feedback is consistently good.

393
01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:51.959
Chenao Yu: like prom good problem solver, very strong contributor, team player and also coaching the junior member. so I I I will propose for a 15 months promotion like given the overalls call and also the availability. I think it's okay. But let's like, wait for the A/C to calibrate and decide. Let's discuss

394
01:18:56.250 --> 01:19:10.129
Rina Su: Yup. But probably I I I I can add a little bit. Here, I think we mean is A is A is A is a really, you know, the 15 months profile really smart, and also willing to work for different modules and fully stuffable.

395
01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:16.349
Rina Su: So I I will, I, I, I to the prop proposed I I will to work with certain

396
01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:17.860
Rina Su: a proposal.

397
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:22.590
SHI.42.South.06: and that I yes, schools.

398
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:44.410
SHI.42.South.06: Any other meals from the committee we discussing, you all remember last around

399
01:19:44.510 --> 01:20:05.150
SHI.42.South.06: we discussed a long time debate on quite a lot of so, because the only one at the time, the only one score is from the CEO of faster right? So. But the other score. It's it's it's it's not bad out that way. It's it's 2, and then sub-scores. There's one. So last time we pushed from 12

400
01:20:05.210 --> 01:20:13.049
SHI.42.South.06: months promoting. So this time for discussion, and then the rep is promoting it. It's it's a it's a proposing the team

401
01:20:13.490 --> 01:20:15.030
SHI.42.South.06: so out of use.

402
01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:30.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's all right 15. That's for for that. That's 15 months.

403
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:43.899
Crystal Hao: Oh, I I just have one more question on. If I I think what I just said that he's very clear a 12 month profile.

404
01:20:44.400 --> 01:20:53.350
Crystal Hao: and also comparing with other 15 months profile. I think his performance is really, you know, I'll send it

405
01:20:53.490 --> 01:21:00.490
Crystal Hao: and basically straight in all dimensions. So I I just I didn't get the the conclusion

406
01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:10.509
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because we crystal. First of all, we do not make any interactive promotions. Secondly, that's time one

407
01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:21.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: he was in tough months promotion decision he supported. And that's why we decided to put this in this cycle, and I think that's a agreement from all

408
01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:22.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the committee last time.

409
01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:30.349
Crystal Hao: But if you can apparently spoil with what we just talk about the me

410
01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:37.959
Crystal Hao: like I I didn't say me me. It's not not good, but they actually they are definitely in 2 different here.

411
01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.540
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And so you could love it, and we try it to figure out

412
01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:31.190
SHI.42.South.06: there's a there's a discussions there. We're wondering why last time it's it's not to be called sample to as a face. Because, yeah, out for me as a 15 months per trial. It's it's for it 12 months. But we may actually call 15 months from okay.

413
01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.270
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

414
01:22:32.540 --> 01:22:38.409
SHI.42.South.06: it's at the availability average for all those stuff.

415
01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:41.580
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

416
01:22:42.280 --> 01:23:09.189
SHI.42.South.06: So like 3 for the 3 ones that you think that for the last 3 months Are they all happening within the last quarter, or like? Are those 3 4 week projects, or are there no stuff like Some? A long. Because I think the last time with probably. Why, if it wasn't voted, is that because the the that we want it is probably happening. A lot of it's happening

417
01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:16.340
SHI.42.South.06: over the past quarter. So last time there wasn't enough data points for the once. But I'm not sure like I'm just

418
01:23:16.350 --> 01:23:18.470
SHI.42.South.06: yes, and that's probably the case.

419
01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:26.930
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes, that's part of the case the. For the last 3 months 2 of them are coming this cycle.

420
01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:47.780
SHI.42.South.06: So

421
01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:59.049
SHI.42.South.06: so we cannot look at the number of the one score. But look at the weight, the average score of the cohort, and so she's quite similar to me. So I guess that's fair.

422
01:23:59.090 --> 01:24:05.980
SHI.42.South.06: probably because in the last cycle the weighted average score of the cohort is not strong enough. I just guess.

423
01:24:06.240 --> 01:24:09.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Huh should be bottom line. So that's why we we

424
01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:11.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: push to this cycle.

425
01:24:12.490 --> 01:24:20.200
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, all right. Shall we move to the next one? There's no more objections.

426
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:32.539
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: jackies! Not here. so shall we move to?

427
01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:40.740
Nicholas Ge: Yeah. So do you? So yeah, honestly, there is no. not too much to discuss. Sorry I'm going up with that that case.

428
01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:50.310
Nicholas Ge:  there's not not too much to discuss about Charlie, because he she is still on the chemicals a common

429
01:24:50.610 --> 01:24:52.810
Nicholas Ge: so end of July.

430
01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:54.610
Nicholas Ge: So

431
01:24:54.820 --> 01:25:07.350
Nicholas Ge: so in Costa cycle. He she does not have any, any, any, any, any any feedback regarding that case. yeah. So so I actually, she has the one question, too.

432
01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:14.340
Nicholas Ge: She like to know that how we all a DC. Evaluate

433
01:25:14.410 --> 01:25:19.919
Nicholas Ge: the feedback from his for be kept to the comment.

434
01:25:21.970 --> 01:25:26.249
Nicholas Ge: I will. It will be taken into consideration for the.

435
01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:30.150
Nicholas Ge: for, the, for, the, for, the, for the, for the, a promotion.

436
01:25:32.010 --> 01:25:35.779
Nicholas Ge: So this is the question to at least you, you also like to collect?

437
01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:36.930
Okay.

438
01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:49.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, because I think what we could do is we can still crack the feedback from the capital. And also, we can actually

439
01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:57.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to have a score back. But but maybe not content in this

440
01:25:57.410 --> 01:26:26.120
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: period. But it really depends on the time where we have our, we get part.

441
01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:54.080
Nicholas Ge: Yeah, I I think the point is that we can together because we can together talk to, because the capital and based on our experience. So give us more on that for reference. But the score will not be so. So how many months team does she need after she come back to, to to Pcc. So it's to prove that she she has the the resonates to to next step.

442
01:26:56.710 --> 01:27:06.140
Nicholas Ge:  to to, to, to, to, to to do paste for another another 3 months or or 6 months after she come back.

443
01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.090
Nicholas Ge: okay. Can you give me some pink about it? The our our expectation.

444
01:27:12.330 --> 01:27:21.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: She's already

445
01:27:22.820 --> 01:27:46.970
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. So so she, I think you have a month because she is 13 right now. Okay, so you know the another 11 month, but she has quite a lot of things to do as A. P. Not finished, and also, though, is quite low. I guess she need a lot of work after coming back.

446
01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:58.709
Nicholas Ge: so I would say that she will need at least 6 months as a a Pcg. As a to execute kicks.

447
01:27:58.890 --> 01:27:59.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes.

448
01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:06.800
Nicholas Ge: this is this is this is my take, at at least right? Okay, okay, that is also good to know.

449
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:17.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright, it's because I'll show you to the next one. That's how you. I know you are in Covid.

450
01:28:17.460 --> 01:28:19.380
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but I can use

451
01:28:19.710 --> 01:28:38.090
Natalie Hua: yes, So then, so now it will stop on health care case for 13 weeks and before she transferred to Stockholm office. She is really a start. strong in all dimensions, and the very outstanding took 0 on project

452
01:28:38.140 --> 01:29:07.499
Natalie Hua: strong commitments, very hard working, strong problem solving, and a very much so client facing. So if we look at her numbers her scores. her is very high and also availability a typical 12 months promotion material. And so is on the line. And he can give more in inputs on Zon's case.

453
01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:35.689
SHI.42.South.06: So Actually, I watched. Shannon. well, from her first case to right now. like She has a very strong presence in both counter. And Cg, so as you can see here in her first case as an essay, I also Seeg case in now. So on. Second case was a was the case scattered by me, and this, and also another one. The reason why you are seeing a was, too.

454
01:29:35.890 --> 01:30:05.439
SHI.42.South.06: it's because that like, she was staff on the online case for like 4 months. And I was living to to some parts of 2 month each, and for the second it's mainly due to the calibration. It's it's not angry. It's it's just due to the calibration reasons why she got calibrated to a 2. And if you look at the subscribers, it's all I think it's all straight ones. for the subscribers for the United Kingdom case, but probably only one and 2

455
01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:16.399
SHI.42.South.06: so If it's not for the the but the calibration it was, it is! It's a clear One for the case!

456
01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:35.780
SHI.42.South.06: And oh, for the hours I'm not sure why, it's only 384 and 144. But it's it's it's definitely more than that. So in overall, it's it's a 4 month case. So that that the hours can be calculated is probably due to that due to some some of the financial reasons.

457
01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:46.929
SHI.42.South.06: But so if we look at the subscribers and also the overall performance. They're 12 months So the only 2 that you're seeing here is due to calibration.

458
01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:55.599
SHI.42.South.06: And I think, she's also finished her first case in the Stockholm office, but probably the

459
01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:04.349
SHI.42.South.06: that the overall, the score of the one and 2 to the 2 scores is inflated.

460
01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:08.020
SHI.42.South.06: And we?

461
01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:15.580
SHI.42.South.06: It's been fighting. Yes, the the

462
01:31:17.770 --> 01:31:19.360
SHI.42.South.06: yes, the it was.

463
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:23.119
SHI.42.South.06: Those are under Megan and

464
01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:27.969
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to be honest, me, and did calibrate this one from one to

465
01:31:28.130 --> 01:31:35.920
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: one and 2 so, which is a 1.5. But indeed they can still have infinite score. So

466
01:31:36.250 --> 01:31:39.669
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: is Committee's decision whether we should recognize that.

467
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:48.069
SHI.42.South.06: But locking to the subsport, it seems. capability, strong capabilities.

468
01:31:48.090 --> 01:32:17.529
SHI.42.South.06: it's recognized right? So when we look at it like a trap subscribers, and also the the other page subscribers. and then even looking at a experience, the case experiencing the previously very unusual like. And then it's across different. And the kickers so wires, and who some mainly ones. So it's a strong one. It's a clear, strong one. So I think I would actually say 12 is fine.

469
01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:20.830
SHI.42.South.06: Thanks that. Oh, great!

470
01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:31.010
SHI.42.South.06: Please say something. Why, you're we just not just as not because people he hasn't on the line. Your room cannot say cannot see you.

471
01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:42.709
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, thank you.

472
01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:49.369
So just a reminder they are

473
01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:57.509
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: from. They can be calibrated back. So those 2 are from the same.

474
01:32:57.750 --> 01:33:10.019
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So that will be up to ours. Our.

475
01:33:25.690 --> 01:33:26.470
yes.

476
01:33:34.650 --> 01:33:39.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but it is already 10 I want to.

477
01:33:45.990 --> 01:34:02.040
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's not very clear it's getting the sound. We are saying that because 2 of the scores are coming from A, we're trying to calculate.

478
01:34:08.630 --> 01:34:10.530
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: just try to be there. Ready.

479
01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:14.179
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, just a moment. Let me.

480
01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:38.140
SHI.42.South.06: And so so just a moment. We were checking what

481
01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.409
SHI.42.South.06: she went for each of her. Let's go.

482
01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:45.880
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That one would be 1.7 5.

483
01:34:47.780 --> 01:34:50.199
SHI.42.South.06: Okay. and that, you know

484
01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:55.350
SHI.42.South.06: one of 5.

485
01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:57.719
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: What what is it

486
01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.429
SHI.42.South.06: if we calibrate the score from a from one to 2,

487
01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:07.259
SHI.42.South.06: the average school will be 1.5 35.7 5. Yeah.

488
01:35:10.410 --> 01:35:15.800
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yes, I say, because

489
01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:17.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 10 min of a month.

490
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:26.650
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, yeah. So I guess.

491
01:35:40.810 --> 01:35:46.080
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, if I may. for May, we know, like

492
01:35:46.450 --> 01:36:08.160
SHI.42.South.06: it's it's probably not. it's probably not the fault. Okay, So for this case. it's also a very tough position, because that for that image in case you know it, it's one of the most important case in health care. I'm going right now. So many of the top performers in health. Here are being staffed on the case.

493
01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:17.969
SHI.42.South.06: for example, for my case, we have Shannon, and also, later on in the a discussion. You also see that here.

494
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:32.330
SHI.42.South.06: Who are probably the 2 strongest analytic machines health care right now. for the case, and with which is a very, very intensive case, and I'm not sure. And also for that. Calibration!

495
01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:51.899
SHI.42.South.06: That's the very least of decision made. During This period of 8 cycle. Right so for the for the one. that you've seen before. It was the. It was the sport in the last cycle, so I'm not sure if that one need to be in calibrated down as well or like. If we we see that

496
01:36:51.910 --> 01:37:01.480
SHI.42.South.06: like Does that mean, like all historical cases that they it have should be calibrated down by by one grid or not, or we only apply not to this to this cycle score.

497
01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:04.020
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So

498
01:37:04.730 --> 01:37:25.330
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: first of all, we should have balanced team for all the cases. So if it is because that a team is not balanced, so we cannot separate. This is this may not be sounds very reasonable from stopping side, I guess. pay more attention next time on your team.

499
01:37:25.610 --> 01:37:30.890
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and and then, for the calibration of the scores.

500
01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:35.150
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the the scores that one is from

501
01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:45.109
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: last year's late October to December, so that one is actually counted into Q. One.

502
01:37:45.180 --> 01:37:54.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If you recall our queue for meeting was in October, so the the cut off day for last year it would be October.

503
01:37:54.300 --> 01:38:11.340
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So this score is definitely 2,023 score, and I still need to be calibrated. We are not counting every scores in the past. I'm making half but the score for 2,023 city year.

504
01:38:12.260 --> 01:38:26.450
SHI.42.South.06: but even for Q. One, because I I I don't recall we had the decision that we want to calibrate down the score for Q, one for the fuel? Or is that the is that the or end line missing something in the last B easy cycle

505
01:38:26.770 --> 01:38:40.630
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we did ask calibration for every every time. but we didn't show the result in Q. One only because most people, most Mdp, they have too few of the inputs.

506
01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:43.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And so we are not may announce a result.

507
01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:47.620
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But

508
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:56.750
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, but now the decision of calibrating down. The so-called Inflat is for was made only in this cycle. Right? It was. It wasn't a communicating last cycle.

509
01:38:57.110 --> 01:39:02.040
SHI.42.South.06: Oh, no, we did. It communicated since us Q. 4,

510
01:39:02.050 --> 01:39:07.960
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also through Mdp meeting and many other scenarios. So we did communicate a lot.

511
01:39:10.190 --> 01:39:23.319
SHI.42.South.06: But then, for this year's score, it's being a scale inflated for this quarter or for for like a 4. 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, or a, it still included.

512
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:27.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Q. One, q. 2 first half. The result is for first half.

513
01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:31.010
SHI.42.South.06: Because why? It's world. It's not where they don't want to

514
01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:34.800
SHI.42.South.06: on that case find a personal school. But anyway.

515
01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:38.599
SHI.42.South.06: But all in the end those few ones businesses phone

516
01:39:38.610 --> 01:39:55.170
SHI.42.South.06: right? I'm not sure if that's fair to calibrate down the the the the score that way, because the business is slow, and probably the more of the top 4 is our scaff on case, and if we calories that down.

517
01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:56.610
SHI.42.South.06: It's not fair to go.

518
01:40:00.650 --> 01:40:14.739
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so I think we already did the calculation right So even if we for the calibrating on the average score on the border line the availability and accumulating hours are all food.

519
01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:38.680
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So we're not saying that we want to push some as promotion to 15 months, right? So for this single case, I think we're fine. However, let's not argue too much about the great inflation, for every Mp. Is there right? As long as you have the number of valuations, we should follow the integration.

520
01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:53.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's also what we had upgrade on yesterday's. So that's fair in mind. we need to that. This is also a way that we should tell that you've been in the keys everyone should.

521
01:40:55.670 --> 01:40:58.150
SHI.42.South.06: Alright, thanks. I waiting. Yeah.

522
01:40:58.410 --> 01:41:10.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. So that's the top one for for now. But keep in mind that all the scores should be calibrate fairly. I'll show you.

523
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:11.840
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Hi!

524
01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:19.689
SHI.42.South.06: But why why not for the investments like maximum businesses don't want her case, or that's can be like 2 basis for investment

525
01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:47.580
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: of of of the project. I mean, some cases, I mean, apparently they they have like 3 large modules with 3 Ppls on the case. So so that that's a different case. Yeah, usually it's it's just 1 1.

526
01:41:48.250 --> 01:41:50.589
SHI.42.South.06: Thanks, my uncle.

527
01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:53.260
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, that's cool.

528
01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:55.469
Natalie Hua: It's not to.

529
01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:21.060
Natalie Hua: Yeah. Ryan. Rya is 10 months seeing essay now. And she stuffed on to Cg projects since last, and for Ryan she delivered very consistent positive very good quality of in the last cycle, and she is very withdraw. She She is a a very strong module owner.

530
01:42:21.060 --> 01:42:34.460
Natalie Hua: and also very reliable, and works very hard for her schools if we don't have the capability is good and the the performance is continuously

531
01:42:34.540 --> 01:42:44.370
Natalie Hua: very stable. So I think she is a 15 month material. We don't need to have too much discussion on this cycle by now.

532
01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:52.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, so this, this

533
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:57.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: make a decision. Maybe my cycle. And us, current

534
01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:02.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: cumulative hours relatively low, and we should

535
01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:07.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: remind her to get up and get more practice

536
01:43:08.090 --> 01:43:09.549
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: on a long case.

537
01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:15.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right. Shall we move to the next one? Our outlook arena.

538
01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:29.470
Rina Su: So you so no last case, Nora. I think her her, her, her her and feedback from the the

539
01:43:29.630 --> 01:43:46.449
Rina Su: But her main issue is the availability. I think she probably to work hard to find the find, find fight cases to be stuff on, whether that stuff, in some case which might not be realized from commercial output. Yeah, that's it. And he, she's still relatively

540
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:50.229
Rina Su: early to discuss promotion window from the next cycle.

541
01:43:50.560 --> 01:44:12.989
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, Nora, I I think she availability issue is only because what she is apparently very stuffable. But The only issue is that she she was hoping to be staff on our case, but we chat which has not been materialized until now. So we we. We are planning to staff her on to a another case from next week.

542
01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:19.119
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, I could. You also remind her, scp, not finish yet.

543
01:44:19.710 --> 01:44:20.820
Rina Su: Well, sure.

544
01:44:21.300 --> 01:44:23.560
Rina Su: really, I think, okay.

545
01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:29.389
SHI.42.South.06: yeah. Next one. Yeah. Next one.

546
01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:31.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: What then, Joe? Okay.

547
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:53.420
Kay Tang: sure. Jordan's case is quite straightforward as well, I think. His feedback has been relatively stable. I heard a lot of positive comments on him. But you know, honestly, it's pretty much only 3 the last 3. I think it's just a preliminary score

548
01:44:53.420 --> 01:45:08.200
Kay Tang: I talked to the Pm. And saying that he's doing a pretty okay job meeting expectation. also list. All course, queues are solid, but previously, I think he is with healthcare background. So

549
01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:26.490
Kay Tang: his previous case, experience is only with health care. So for this case, he's trying to ramp up and also there, there's some room for him to to improve. he's really diligence hot walking, and the well push him himself very hard

550
01:45:26.490 --> 01:45:54.180
Kay Tang: in terms of you know, driving for the in size and climb management, so on and so forth. So the current Pm, saying that she well reevalued his performance. when the case get finished. So the 3 is only, for in preliminary, in terms of the billability, I think the number is quite low, because I think previously, he's still investment. And for now he's still partially available on the current case.

551
01:45:54.180 --> 01:45:57.969
Kay Tang: So I think he needs to solve that problem as well.

552
01:45:58.550 --> 01:46:07.889
Kay Tang: and also the the scp is is the tempting issue for him as well. That's pretty much for him. It's too too early to discuss.

553
01:46:10.110 --> 01:46:12.160
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

554
01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:16.509
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So we want to next one. Kevin job.

555
01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:46.619
SHI.42.South.06: Yes, it's a challenging place for Kevin. he has quite low availability, and from the recent feedback, I guess. it's it's just also The reason case he was working on the internal T one case for the Trading Institution institution with Regina Tag. The the feedback is He has not by strong ownership for the more juice.

556
01:46:46.650 --> 01:47:11.449
SHI.42.South.06: and he has not the ownership to drive to solve the issues. However, there are some special case that probably we need to take into account. One is Kevin just became a a new that from the Regina's case, the second one is It is because it's not the client bit about. So, Regina Regina just commented.

557
01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:17.350
SHI.42.South.06: That's probably also one of the reason why Ken is not so driven on the on the on a case.

558
01:47:18.090 --> 01:47:38.039
SHI.42.South.06: Heaven is now working on a pat case. It's 25% available. I guess it's it's it's quite critical for him. To prove his capability and potential. probably for for the for the following. for for him!

559
01:47:38.040 --> 01:47:54.699
SHI.42.South.06: So I guess. probably it's our Cv. decision to decide if we need to put him on. The watch out or ref that. But I guess the case is a little bit similar, as Jordan's case.

560
01:47:55.390 --> 01:48:06.800
SHI.42.South.06: because they joined the firm in last October. Our getting slow, and it's quite challenging for them to be staffable.

561
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:35.429
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, yeah, go. Well, Kevin, Kevin's situation is a little bit special this year. I think he he! I think his wife got back, and so so he has some family issue. And he he, he personally didn't want to travel out of Shanghai, so there was a One of the reasons why it was difficult to get him stopped. also, I think

562
01:48:35.590 --> 01:48:48.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I mean, as Chov has mentioned, that I mean he is not very strong in terms of a performance. So there was also There was also another reason why he he he hasn't got

563
01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:50.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: stop for for quite a long time.

564
01:48:51.430 --> 01:49:01.779
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, for his current Dd case. actually talked to the Pl a few days ago, and the the piano said,

565
01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:05.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's not very productive and

566
01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:08.340
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: or not, let's say, not very offensive

567
01:49:08.530 --> 01:49:15.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: in the work, but they are considering, if rolling him off or not.

568
01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:35.280
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm not sure. Michael, if they already made the decision. But there's also a point. Yeah, because the case was passed for for for for for some time. So I think the the they haven't made a decision yet. But apparently Kevin was not one of the one of the good performers in the case.

569
01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:48.529
SHI.42.South.06: Erez agmoni. If we try to hold a bar on Aec, both cases are after 10 months, they are still on investment with extremely low availability. Those 2 cases are a typical very.

570
01:49:48.660 --> 01:49:54.939
SHI.42.South.06: I mean, we respected that there has no family issues, but it seems he's welcome to take her away.

571
01:49:56.830 --> 01:50:02.510
SHI.42.South.06: So I I guess if those 2 are not a red flag, and I'm more difficult to maintain, the

572
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:07.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah,

573
01:50:07.370 --> 01:50:11.120
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so shall we put them? Or

574
01:50:12.620 --> 01:50:14.970
SHI.42.South.06: on the

575
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:18.190
SHI.42.South.06: so there we are progressing.

576
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:23.309
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, hey, Travis, Do you have objection on that?

577
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:31.489
SHI.42.South.06: I agree on that. I guess. personally, I I believe there is a potential for Kevin.

578
01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.050
SHI.42.South.06: it's quite difficult for him to be staffable.

579
01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:55.269
Kay Tang: Well, for Jordan, I think I think I think the point I I want to raise is that, for from from his previous Pm. I think all the all the feedbacks are are positive

580
01:50:55.560 --> 01:51:00.780
Kay Tang: and the keys on the case right now. although it's partially available.

581
01:51:00.910 --> 01:51:12.419
Kay Tang: So I think. Well, is there any reason that we tell him that he's doing a okay job, and he's on the case. And he's still got onto the reflag list.

582
01:51:14.490 --> 01:51:27.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I actually do agree with K. Because we didn't hear anything. Not very negative on Jordan, though. The No. But for a cabin the the case feedbacks relatively more

583
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:32.110
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to to the negative side. So I I do see difference between those 2.

584
01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:57.430
SHI.42.South.06: Great, I think. Jordan, from the feedback at the school. It seems that like It's It's a may need some longer runway, but so far Performance at the tennis! It's It's fine! It's still learning right so. But, Kevin, I heard. It's potential. It's very limited. So I think it's different. It's too.

585
01:51:57.590 --> 01:52:24.349
SHI.42.South.06: and join them. Maybe you can consider the time. Watch out, because, as like 10 months, right? I was fast. Track is 12 months. And so he's already 10. Yeah, yeah, I I agree. But I would recommend that. Let's see if that makes sense, I would recommend. let me come, communicate with Jordan and tell him that he's pretty dangerous, you know, regarding his current situation, because previously no one has said any negative feedback to him.

586
01:52:24.610 --> 01:52:35.709
Kay Tang: although the case is only within health care. But you know, within that group it's it's pretty positive. And then I'm I'm I'm actually kind surprised to see the scores all all these

587
01:52:35.810 --> 01:52:49.490
Kay Tang: because, you know, people are seeing good was in the of him. So let me do that, and see if he cannot get it to, or at least a very strong 3 the current case, and then we can put him on the watch our list. How about that?

588
01:52:50.930 --> 01:52:58.000
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, can I maybe take another look at this case on the start dating in date for that.

589
01:52:58.370 --> 01:53:01.210
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

590
01:53:01.240 --> 01:53:07.080
SHI.42.South.06: So the only thing for the previous 3 threes.

591
01:53:07.170 --> 01:53:26.940
SHI.42.South.06: it's probably because he's still in investment during that period. So if we look at, we joined the firm last August, and finished his second latest case on in Fairfax in February. So that's up still with the best security, and that's all that's for

592
01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:38.340
SHI.42.South.06: the 3 space kind of came So the only thing like cause some from calculation, generally feedback within health care is pretty good.

593
01:53:38.530 --> 01:53:46.559
SHI.42.South.06: The only surprise is the very latest 3. I'm not sure why it's that, but we can't. We can't really get on that one with it.

594
01:53:46.780 --> 01:54:01.989
Kay Tang: Sorry. So for the very latest one. Actually, it's a on ongoing case. I talked to Stella. She's saying that she will re review the the rating until the case get finished. So for now it's just a ballpark number.

595
01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:04.240
SHI.42.South.06: Okay.

596
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:27.659
SHI.42.South.06: it's okay. for Jordan. What you described is the essentially of what shop already, you know. it's like, seriously serious for me. you, you need to know, like what shop. It's not an an official one. A red flag is yeah. And then there's no, it's it's what trial is not necessary. If next time there's no improvements, and the

597
01:54:27.660 --> 01:54:45.770
SHI.42.South.06: and it can be. we can put it in a graph that directly. No, it's it's it's not necessary. Go through what? Okay? So what? You just yeah. Propose in terms of like a serious talk about it, etc., literally in terms of the meeting. It's already what I would try with.

598
01:54:50.170 --> 01:54:57.689
SHI.42.South.06: How about that? Well.

599
01:54:57.930 --> 01:55:08.720
SHI.42.South.06: and I would ask, Yeah, yeah, I just excuse me. I I just like a one question to my call it with Kevin on the red flag, is it? I mean.

600
01:55:08.890 --> 01:55:18.429
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, that's that's where does it help Kevin? to to be stable on the other case? Because.

601
01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:39.729
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, definitely. I think I think it will be a It will be actually an extra help for him. I I I I think I mean in terms of stuffing. because I so far, it's It's very, very difficult to stop him. So I it all Well, if we can stop him as a free resource, then we'll be much more help.

602
01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:43.430
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: much more easy to get himself. Yes.

603
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:46.329
SHI.42.South.06: okay, good to know.

604
01:55:46.670 --> 01:56:00.049
SHI.42.South.06: I understand. Captain is doing something internal world. Yes, health care, right? So probably I guess it would be a good vote. a situation for him to his staff. So which is, consider, try to help and get stuff. Yeah.

605
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:08.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. So I was saying, Cookie Jordan on watch out and also have a

606
01:56:15.760 --> 01:56:17.020
SHI.42.South.06: next one.

607
01:56:19.370 --> 01:56:28.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so that's all for S. A. To C promotion discussion. I think we're still using one from Let's check it back.

608
01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:38.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I will leave that plan. Shall we move back to sherry.

609
01:56:40.330 --> 01:56:42.660
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. Sherry.

610
01:56:43.090 --> 01:56:45.329
SHI.42.South.06: I got some message from Jesus.

611
01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:58.050
SHI.42.South.06: Okay? So it seems like to the recent. that case one is a sure we deserve the one. So the reason is because it's it's not a cost case. It's in the china. So the

612
01:56:58.050 --> 01:57:27.390
SHI.42.South.06: with an overseas pl and some overseas stuff, and I was sharing on China site, and then the apparently from, she told me, overseas like the P. And then he was not a super. I would say capable. So therefore, also make sure we did a majority many of the work, and then on more than what was initially expected, and did very well in terms of the

613
01:57:27.430 --> 01:57:51.400
SHI.42.South.06: like cause supporting the read out with the kind, etc. So that's why like teach home give of a calibrated it to be the one. Okay, that's a here which I I think are fair. And then this is consistent with my observation that sherry is in. She works very independently, and she's she does your challenge, you know, actually

614
01:57:51.400 --> 01:58:06.719
SHI.42.South.06: Or a client on the High Court, and then meditate it so in this I see this girl, as you know, you know, one year, 2 years ago she she expects confidence to speak her, but now she's

615
01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:15.780
SHI.42.South.06: I think she's quite, you know, she has the critical thinking and the strong ownership to try things on her own that I think countries where

616
01:58:16.140 --> 01:58:18.240
SHI.42.South.06: she's ready for it myself.

617
01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.410
SHI.42.South.06: Hello

618
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:28.689
SHI.42.South.06: for Jerry. You propose like 18, like or 21 superposed 1,800,

619
01:58:33.230 --> 01:58:47.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think he proposed 18 earlier. even if the break that 1, 2, 2 based on mainly because his whole score is stimulated, even though the score is still falling into

620
01:58:47.850 --> 01:58:49.759
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 18 month range, I guess.

621
01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:53.680
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, yeah. And let's make it 18.

622
01:58:53.790 --> 01:59:08.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: 18. Okay? And it's happiness, right? The other one. And this we look at the so

623
01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:22.040
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so if we the the other 50% billing from the auto agnostic, Ypd would be 78%

624
01:59:22.050 --> 01:59:28.849
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: half month's role rolling find it will be pretty fixed, and cohort will be 31.

625
01:59:30.970 --> 01:59:39.940
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That's a that's a as

626
01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:51.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's actually around you bought from each one. So ytt is definitely not bottom. It's for a and a half month is

627
01:59:51.690 --> 01:59:53.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: is

628
01:59:54.410 --> 01:59:58.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: oh, actually about

629
01:59:59.870 --> 02:00:05.990
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for I say yes from both.

630
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:25.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes, you can see in the bottom bottom 20 for essay is around 20. Something

631
02:00:25.550 --> 02:00:34.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: right? Cohort is 1, 2, the top one is 26. And now for admin, if we're accounting with those 50% would be 36 and 31.

632
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:37.790
SHI.42.South.06: Hello!

633
02:00:38.500 --> 02:00:45.410
SHI.42.South.06: So it looks like, what the committee you think about this is that like 21? That's the case.

634
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:52.880
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah. I think performance wise. She is a 21.

635
02:00:52.940 --> 02:01:05.729
Jeffrey Gao: But the the availability. I don't think I agree with K, right? So if it's already preset before she got stopped on the the auto case, then we should consider. So we readjust

636
02:01:05.830 --> 02:01:11.479
Jeffrey Gao: this into the availability and also accumulated hours for correct.

637
02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:17.199
Jeffrey Gao: So then we this consider, I think it's a 21.

638
02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:24.140
any of you. Yes.

639
02:01:24.250 --> 02:01:24.959
SHI.42.South.06: thank you.

640
02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:29.700
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, okay, yeah, let's make it 21. Then.

641
02:01:30.630 --> 02:01:32.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay,

642
02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:36.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: let's let's do the calibration for

643
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:38.530
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay.

644
02:01:39.750 --> 02:01:41.650
SHI.42.South.06: for the free motion

645
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:47.269
SHI.42.South.06: took it to peace. I

646
02:01:47.490 --> 02:01:48.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it is not that?

647
02:01:49.530 --> 02:01:51.499
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, that's still the pre promotion.

648
02:01:51.690 --> 02:01:54.159
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Well, that's that's do the calibration first.

649
02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:56.190
SHI.42.South.06: Oh, okay.

650
02:01:56.830 --> 02:01:58.020
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh.

651
02:01:58.820 --> 02:02:04.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so Kara John is 21 month endlessly 21 month.

652
02:02:04.690 --> 02:02:09.669
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Cherry J. Was 18. That one would be next cycle

653
02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:18.620
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to discuss Franklin. the system cycle. You say 15 months, 10 min, 15 months. You'll now we'll wait for

654
02:02:18.760 --> 02:02:20.919
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that is but once it

655
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:25.750
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and so you will be next next cycle

656
02:02:26.340 --> 02:02:28.250
So on that top month.

657
02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:33.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and then on, what shouts

658
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:35.279
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: have a on reflect

659
02:02:43.660 --> 02:02:46.219
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: moving to for the caliber.

660
02:02:48.060 --> 02:02:52.399
SHI.42.South.06: So no opportunity for the comments on the television.

661
02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:58.300
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Take a look. Yeah, all right. So let's move to next.

662
02:02:59.170 --> 02:02:59.960
SHI.42.South.06: Okay

663
02:03:06.880 --> 02:03:09.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: on preliminary promotion.

664
02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:16.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: First one is

665
02:03:22.520 --> 02:03:41.430
Hi, So Ethan is a well-rounded senior associate. with consistently outperforms. we've proven himself. with capabilities, handling a variety of cases. on to deal gins strategy new business Bill natural cases. So

666
02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:52.789
so there's nothing to to, to to flag. So, since he's only 9 months into senior associate. So I don't think there is a decision that needs to be made now.

667
02:03:52.820 --> 02:04:15.019
TAI.Yuguang Island: However, a previous message is that he's also a strongly staffable across industry. He has done a couple of long cases with Alto with Brian collie. So the hours of a different Ipa. The functionability requirement has been fulfilled. So the only requirement now is to get a 2

668
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:17.340
following a 6 and Ipa.

669
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.490
So that's where we are at, for even like

670
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:35.639
so he has scored highly. quasi-s! And one breakthrough from the past cycle is that he was able to drive the client team

671
02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:48.200
in 9 0 business partnership opportunity negotiation. So that's the one thing that the Ppl. He has worked with. I want to highlight.

672
02:04:51.110 --> 02:05:01.709
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you. looks. That is not much issue for even Besides. he's you need to fulfill a sap. So to remind him.

673
02:05:02.060 --> 02:05:04.020
TAI.Yuguang Island: Yes, yes.

674
02:05:04.350 --> 02:05:09.520
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's why I said, that's it. Richard.

675
02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:12.280
Richard Guo: Yes.

676
02:05:12.420 --> 02:05:21.630
Richard Guo: judging is 9 months Actually. I think from if we look as a number yeah, there's a bit

677
02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:24.559
Richard Guo: of trouble. so he

678
02:05:24.930 --> 02:05:31.909
Richard Guo: from the downward feedback, I think it's she got 2, 3 in recent

679
02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:33.270
Richard Guo: cases.

680
02:05:34.320 --> 02:05:40.140
Richard Guo: and also, the the availability is is not not quite good.

681
02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:44.389
Richard Guo: I think. But there are some reason behind. we'll talk later.

682
02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:54.080
Richard Guo: So from from, I think from the data we'll see some trouble. But if he if when I talk to the Ppl. who worked with

683
02:05:54.090 --> 02:06:02.489
Richard Guo: that in, I I think, overall. the feedback still positive. So Ppls recognize, judging

684
02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:08.980
Richard Guo: Great attitude. the positive contribution also his analytics

685
02:06:09.180 --> 02:06:13.200
Richard Guo: capability. It's ownership, etc.

686
02:06:13.330 --> 02:06:25.859
Richard Guo: But the the problem solving. I think. Still, yeah, to be improved. and as a that will be too ready for the next next level.

687
02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:46.449
Richard Guo: so probably we can. We can discuss a bit about the first one is about his capability. I know charging worked with Erica a lot in in the recent monthses on different Bd topics. Probably Erica can can

688
02:06:46.690 --> 02:06:50.630
Richard Guo: share his her observation on the call.

689
02:06:51.850 --> 02:07:15.269
SHI.42.South.06: Okay? So judging, I will be on a few minutes to my house and the hospital pay a private topic, and then, especially on the one of the key transformation and also hospital operation optimization. we are a very strong commitment and partnership to support the

690
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:34.990
SHI.42.South.06: You know what are the key numbers for hospital improvement, and that, and I can tell that he he's really expert and in the field, with good. Know how we strong analytics to understand our potential client situation for a customized approach.

691
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:38.299
SHI.42.South.06: So I do see that that

692
02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:46.950
SHI.42.South.06: he he's even if he's us up in a project. It's from the B, his process. It shows the conventional concept.

693
02:07:52.770 --> 02:08:01.080
Richard Guo: Thanks. Thanks. Erica. Yeah. I I think, for from a capability right, the performance wise is is really about

694
02:08:01.210 --> 02:08:09.160
Richard Guo:  Further improve problem solving, I think, for for the attitude, the kind ownership contribution role model, that that's all.

695
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:24.349
Richard Guo: if I look at the the poly and count result it is, is still on track And also I want to discuss a bit about his availability. Right? So he he didn't really.

696
02:08:24.390 --> 02:08:30.350
Richard Guo:  That's staffing opportunities, I mean recent

697
02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:40.420
Richard Guo: cycle. I I I heard the mayor would like to stop him, but but I think he missed the case of because of like some house

698
02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:48.800
Richard Guo: health reasons. And also jd, jing, dong, the PPI would like to stuff him. But I think there's some other

699
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:51.069
Richard Guo: reasons. He he's not being stopped.

700
02:08:51.130 --> 02:09:01.130
Richard Guo: probably, Michael, if if you you you can show me also talk about a bit about the stuffing saying about that.

701
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:12.479
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Well, I I think he he well. he does have some challenges about being staff, I think already

702
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:19.729
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because he his previous case performance.

703
02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:37.129
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I I'm not sure I I don't think it health care. Oh, ppl, so I would like to stop him again. maybe because he he didn't do quite well with with the the ddk, he

704
02:09:37.270 --> 02:09:46.650
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But the That case was really, really, really tough

705
02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:57.209
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and he he himself didn't want to get on to Pds again, because he, he said, he has some kind of health issues. So

706
02:09:57.690 --> 02:10:10.219
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, there was. really no one. who one wanting to to to st him. So that's that's that. That's his issue. I I don't know if

707
02:10:10.530 --> 02:10:17.220
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: if we want to consider putting him out. What child or a reflex I mean, given his

708
02:10:17.690 --> 02:10:22.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: his performance data and and availability challenge.

709
02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:26.140
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So yeah, especially

710
02:10:26.490 --> 02:10:34.750
SHI.42.South.06: homegrown. Yeah, it's phone grow. And that mouse only has like, 300 h. So I think this is definitely a reflex.

711
02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:43.310
SHI.42.South.06: I think he's 6. I guess he's a later hire from a big 4. So

712
02:10:43.330 --> 02:10:49.609
SHI.42.South.06: yeah. But if you look at the the school, she still has the A has so many projects there.

713
02:10:49.870 --> 02:11:13.639
Richard Guo: So he was promoted. He he was hired as an associate. Yeah, yeah. But he was promoted to us a like, so sort of like, a home wrong? Yeah. In a Paul hard, I still buy solid. The only at the beginning, but he was after he was promoted to essay.

714
02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:36.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: There was a lot of challenges I mean in terms of the saving I I I wasn't sure whether it was because of that particular Dd case. he he sort of like failed on on that case. And so there was Maybe there was. Why he no one wanted to to to, to to continue stopping him again from in healthcare

715
02:11:36.290 --> 02:11:44.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So we which was his like his home, and after. And he also did. He didn't do well in

716
02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:54.430
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: in a in this consumer case, right So so maybe that was also because he he wasn't chosen by the the jingle team.

717
02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:56.330
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So

718
02:11:56.550 --> 02:12:20.190
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, I I actually more different topics. He's a a bit as a as a as a as a I think he should be to over enough to various topics, but not limited to what he's familiar with. That's a key. message that I would bring in

719
02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:26.370
SHI.42.South.06: looking at the schools and the hearing both that being set

720
02:12:26.490 --> 02:12:30.730
SHI.42.South.06: about a like a a bit about

721
02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.090
SHI.42.South.06: cases, right? So of course, there's also missing opportunities.

722
02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:40.439
SHI.42.South.06: I think it's a a lease of what child, or even worth after.

723
02:12:41.110 --> 02:12:50.290
SHI.42.South.06: So it's a whole growth are supposed to be like that. So and then I agree with the message

724
02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:53.029
SHI.42.South.06: just mention about, think it's a reflex.

725
02:12:53.500 --> 02:13:00.270
Richard Guo: if we may. I probably we should give a watch out instead of that. That, because

726
02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:09.970
Richard Guo: it's when you talk to P. I's really divided view. Right. it's only the 2 cases. One is retail is The Ppl. Had left the company

727
02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:20.830
Richard Guo: and then it's about a a CD right. I I I I give also given. The tenure is just 9 months. I I think probably we should

728
02:13:20.940 --> 02:13:26.200
Richard Guo: give a watch all and deliver some strong message. But but really we we can look at

729
02:13:26.330 --> 02:13:33.659
Richard Guo:  charging performance in the next cycle to really decide if if that's

730
02:13:33.890 --> 02:13:37.810
Richard Guo: capability issue, or it's just because of the

731
02:13:38.250 --> 02:13:55.759
Shelley Liu: the specific case stuffing, stuffing. He shouldn't. Yeah, I I I my audio, has some issue just now, so you can't hear me. He actually worked with me on the audio case. I would say that he didn't really fail the case, but I wouldn't give him a to it, meaning because

732
02:13:55.780 --> 02:14:12.119
Shelley Liu: he was not that motivated. So it like. If you gave him. If you gave him a task, you can finish it well, but he's he's the one that you have to push him to move forward. I don't think that's worth a to for an essay level.

733
02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:14.900
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah. Yeah.

734
02:14:16.050 --> 02:14:45.930
SHI.42.South.06: But isn't this last? And they're like February. So it's now what's what I'll have at that from from February the second to here, if it's a your availability picking stuff, sure surely would you? Would you be willing to stop him again? No, it's not a to it should be I I know, I know, but what I'm saying is that I mean term from like healthcare perspective. W, would you guys want to stop him again? Because I mean, we we really had a hard time finding him a case.

735
02:14:45.980 --> 02:14:49.050
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I mean, even though like that. Yeah.

736
02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:51.570
SHI.42.South.06: And then because

737
02:14:51.710 --> 02:15:04.600
Shelley Liu: if I have an option, I will definitely be willing to use the better option, but like, if not, I think he's the one that's He can't handle the tasks. If you assign the test to him clearly.

738
02:15:06.480 --> 02:15:24.820
SHI.42.South.06: I think we should give him a heads up to not be picky. I think my main concern is the last case, ended February the second, and after that I think a lot of healthcare is installed right after that. But is it? Is it the the comic? And Pbo doesn't want to choose import? He doesn't want to be on any of that.

739
02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I don't.

740
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:34.900
Shelley Liu: I don't really think he's in health care background, though, before I mean even for the audio, because I thought he was.

741
02:15:35.130 --> 02:15:42.019
SHI.42.South.06: It's a lot of fun. It's not to be on the other. She's cases as well. Right?

742
02:15:42.020 --> 02:16:06.770
SHI.42.South.06: So yeah. So he he's he's between Cg and health care, and on the project. This is the one that we should give up to exactly. I mean, I mean, if it's that, give it a message. You know I've tried all my challenges like not with that. I think we're talking about when they watch what's out already.

743
02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:12.400
SHI.42.South.06: because if he has only 300 h. He cannot make it.

744
02:16:12.440 --> 02:16:19.320
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, with 9 months 3 h, 300 something. But I will still say it's in the red back.

745
02:16:19.330 --> 02:16:34.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, and also calibrate with Kevin. If you remember, earlier, 10 months was much more hours And similarly, 2 cases start a negative feedback, but no attitude issue then I guess

746
02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:37.899
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I guess this is their.

747
02:16:38.410 --> 02:16:44.110
SHI.42.South.06: It's a chemist's availability, as the case capability for the Ycd. Availability.

748
02:16:49.459 --> 02:16:54.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I've been this many because he's still in the investment period, right for the climb.

749
02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:58.490
SHI.42.South.06: But

750
02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:15.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's a different start for home ground, and that we rarely see home growing and say, Well, we have to say he has. He's left her hiring a but actually promoted we rarely see someone like that would have such low tea and hard to stop

751
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:17.370
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: as he could.

752
02:17:18.320 --> 02:17:23.170
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

753
02:17:23.299 --> 02:17:29.079
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: all right, let's move on to the next one Lauren's.

754
02:17:32.049 --> 02:17:33.299
SHI.42.South.06: Thomas is up.

755
02:17:36.059 --> 02:17:40.469
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That's

756
02:17:41.230 --> 02:18:05.099
SHI.42.South.06: yeah. So kit is. I was recently to just finishing a case, and also got staff on and on. The was in case was from to the office and was on a a Esg project to help a leading semiconductor or a Tmt company to develop the the

757
02:18:05.100 --> 02:18:28.179
SHI.42.South.06: Esg strategy on not only how to reduce carbon emissions from themselves, but also from their suppliers, or a lot of them are actually quite difficult. There was no previous experience. So a lot of them has to be developed, even from the methodology, from the very, very bottom up way in addition. And also during the process, there's a complex climate management, and also

758
02:18:28.180 --> 02:18:52.139
SHI.42.South.06: science stakeholder. Navigation! And Essentially, Ken is in that case. I think he's He's done majority of the work, and also he's overseeing. at least one junior aids on that case. So as you can see, the Dasha, a majority of the subscribers are very high in the in, and also for that case which started from last November till

759
02:18:52.139 --> 02:19:12.230
SHI.42.South.06: this to to to this April. I was it was a a high one. So for the Kenneth, I think, given that there's no availability, and also the very good performance from the case pm, and also the ndp. we can probably put it into consideration for 12 months for now.

760
02:19:14.969 --> 02:19:26.759
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  I think the trajectory, and also very, very high.

761
02:19:26.809 --> 02:19:30.219
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: The the only thing is

762
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:41.199
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's why it's a little bit inflated so hopefully. For next I call the collaboration result will be better so that she won't be affected.

763
02:19:41.950 --> 02:19:42.879
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

764
02:19:45.340 --> 02:19:47.449
SHI.42.South.06: we yes, we

765
02:19:47.559 --> 02:19:51.359
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: moving to the next one. Kitty trail. Charty.

766
02:19:52.730 --> 02:20:09.430
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Yeah. So Kitty's 9 months in as everyone else on there. I think she's demonstrating, you know. Good progress within within her cases will be at school, so it's consistent to I don't think you know. So you know, 12 months time to

767
02:20:09.430 --> 02:20:24.580
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: essentially 15, probably someone's 18 months. You know what she did in the in the coming cycle. she's strength in communication presence, particularly around oral communication

768
02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:43.039
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: card interactions and teaming. her afd is definitely around practicing effects that just needs to improve her. Her speech output. I don't think any any concerns at this stage The only thing is just making sure that she

769
02:20:43.140 --> 02:21:10.030
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: continues to get stopped. She is very proactive in that. In reaching out trying to find stuff, you know, opportunities. obviously, at the moment it's more difficult. and I think her Us. She is exactly right in terms of she will do whatever she's asked to do whether it be on Bds or all the cases. So you know. Good, good person to have on the team. But I don't think any decision needs to be made right now.

770
02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:31.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Well, she I think she's yeah. Yes, she's in the very proactive. But I I think she's mainly interested in cross-office opportunities like Southeast Asia, or or even me. But The issue is that we don't. We don't have that many cost opportunities this year.

771
02:21:31.310 --> 02:21:53.799
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So in Hong Kong currently is relatively slow. So I I I guess we should. We can encourage her to consider like Mainline opportunities as well, although I mean, it's still difficult to probably to get her sampling on to mainline cases. But maybe you she can be a little bit more flexible in terms of that.

772
02:21:54.270 --> 02:22:09.899
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Yeah, yeah, I think you know, she's only been looking for some decision Middle East, because there is what the options is historically. but I think she is also open to to going to to Mainland to get stopped. let me speak to. How about that, Michael?

773
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:11.350
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah.

774
02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:13.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright.

775
02:22:13.940 --> 02:22:19.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: he charted. So we moved to next one. Tracy, Chicago.

776
02:22:21.570 --> 02:22:33.680
Zhigang Shi: Yeah, Tracy, so Shizi is obviously a very good performer and receiving consistently good feedback from and way case more importantly, I check with the Pl.

777
02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:54.170
Zhigang Shi: And that she is not just good at doing his her homework, but also being able now to, you know, interact directly with with the client, because the Pia also sometimes have to work on some Bds there for a lot of what client action is now on Tracy.

778
02:22:54.570 --> 02:22:57.709
Zhigang Shi: because, Tracy,

779
02:22:58.400 --> 02:23:12.000
Zhigang Shi: I will go to this one thing. I did the notice because I saw that, for Tmt. Case was in her 8, and you went out. Oh, sorry it was in. She's her with it now that

780
02:23:12.040 --> 02:23:20.980
Zhigang Shi: she didn't finish completed the scp. Right if I see on your march on the Powerpoint.

781
02:23:23.450 --> 02:23:25.460
Zhigang Shi: yes.

782
02:23:25.940 --> 02:23:31.639
Zhigang Shi: but the tricky thing is that after she come back from? She she will be automatically consultant. Right?

783
02:23:32.890 --> 02:23:34.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. Truth.

784
02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:37.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I I don't think there's much to worry for.

785
02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:39.960
Zhigang Shi: Okay.

786
02:23:42.310 --> 02:23:43.050
Zhigang Shi: yeah.

787
02:23:44.370 --> 02:23:49.609
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thanks. Shall we go to the next one? let's see long. Tell me.

788
02:23:56.570 --> 02:24:05.749
Tammy Tan: yes, Sorry. I'm muted. Vincey, I think. Vincey, performance is quite stable. in the pasta cycles.

789
02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:08.960
Tammy Tan: If you look at the scores, you go straight

790
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:19.829
Tammy Tan: 3 tools. Actually, I checked with the pl. These 2 are all very strong tools very well around their consulting skills. very efficient problem solving is strong

791
02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:40.509
Tammy Tan: and also great ownership or cases. Some actually see her as a very strong candidate for consultant. Actually, she's also already doing consultants for cases, and even having associates under her So I think overall definitely a strong candidate.

792
02:24:40.730 --> 02:25:02.110
Tammy Tan: And the availability is fine. Right? A little bit low, I will. I I anyway. But I don't think she has any vulnerability or stability issue at all. she was a home girl associate and a promoted to essay at to, and 24 months. areas for development is more about I think improved

793
02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:13.989
Tammy Tan: presence in front of senior people. and I'll be more proactive in discussions. She definitely have a good view, but just the needs to be more encouraged for outspoken

794
02:25:14.190 --> 02:25:21.140
Tammy Tan: we don't need to resign now, but we will see next to cycle, and whether she fits for for 12 or 15, that's all.

795
02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:25.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Let me Your site is a on track.

796
02:25:26.020 --> 02:25:30.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so We'll meet you next one, and you've all the remote.

797
02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:44.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It's not with us for now So maybe moving to next stage

798
02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:54.189
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  one more high Yahoo!

799
02:25:56.520 --> 02:26:17.530
Yue Hong Zhang: Hi! Everyone so moo high as a reminder, right? So he was a industry higher that we got on the A. So he had a big above bumpy road as a right to time to adapt. But we see actually he turned around quite well and got relatively positive. feedback, as I say, right, as you can see from

800
02:26:17.870 --> 02:26:28.620
Yue Hong Zhang: from from his recent you know, scoring, he basically get a consistent tool. So he will, mainly in the high scale practice, and

801
02:26:29.050 --> 02:26:58.440
Yue Hong Zhang: and essentially quite got good traction with with the current pier. Right? The ability to raise is is is also close to average. I think you know his strength essentially is driven by the part that he's a very much motivated and show a lot of ownership right in this module. I think one of the area for development that we've heard is, you know, as it grows into the role, right? And, you know, start to to take more mature things. I think you know you.

802
02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:01.899
Yue Hong Zhang: It will be useful to to simplify messages

803
02:27:01.900 --> 02:27:21.889
Yue Hong Zhang: and think more about sorry dining right? I think overall. I think you know, we see I wouldn't. I would see. Basically, it's a it's good, you know. Turn around compared to to previous situation, right and start to to get to get himself on on the on the right track. I think you know, scoring is also in the middle of

804
02:27:21.940 --> 02:27:25.140
Yue Hong Zhang: you know, on track as a average.

805
02:27:27.020 --> 02:27:32.930
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. So performance wise, that's that's on track.

806
02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:36.329
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but from a a charity we would like to be

807
02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:58.590
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: some more information on new high We actually received few feedback from our collaborative hotels. saying that we have been following a lot of complaints to our hotels as they're supporting for in 3 House House several in 3 months.

808
02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:01.060
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It was worse

809
02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:04.939
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: with worse relatively extreme.

810
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:13.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and sometimes not asking a solution, but just to complain. And express the the

811
02:28:13.450 --> 02:28:39.660
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I guess the anger with things like that. It's straight way. And we want to bring those to city discussion to see if that really aligned with our value. And also would that be a hindered to a PC. Image outside of the in the business trip scenario, and also a side of this hotel complaints, we ask. We also received

812
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:41.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: similar

813
02:28:41.400 --> 02:29:02.699
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: complain for Icb vendors from the high very similar situation that you use. Extreme worse. It's it's it's from situation, personal behavior. so we wonder if that's really a good way to solve things worse.

814
02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:09.230
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So some of the issues he encountered in this is on search. True?

815
02:29:10.530 --> 02:29:19.769
Yue Hong Zhang: Yeah. I think that that that's also, you know I've receives as a see the advisor right? I've received some anonymous source of

816
02:29:19.890 --> 02:29:30.850
Yue Hong Zhang: not not an English to me, but I can all complain right from people he interacted with that. reflect. Some, I would say of Bcg value concerns

817
02:29:30.890 --> 02:29:37.250
Yue Hong Zhang: right in terms of you know, essentially being respectful to the team or

818
02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:40.880
Yue Hong Zhang:  basically, like, you know, using the

819
02:29:40.930 --> 02:29:51.479
Yue Hong Zhang: the the right home right? and it to towards our team members both in the Ct and and the that's that's a fair concern that's been raised.

820
02:29:53.940 --> 02:30:01.379
Zhigang Shi: Yeah. And we should be mindful. Right? So the power of social media.

821
02:30:01.570 --> 02:30:10.280
Zhigang Shi: if these kind of things get exposed to the social media, and you know, spread out, and it will be on the even sometimes of prices.

822
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:16.849
Zhigang Shi: So I mean, until then we should fix that before you.

823
02:30:17.010 --> 02:30:33.530
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But this is why we're bringing this up.

824
02:30:34.090 --> 02:30:34.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I was

825
02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:47.719
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so sometimes it's okay to, you know, to file a valid complaint, but it seems that the

826
02:30:48.910 --> 02:31:00.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. So

827
02:31:00.860 --> 02:31:05.070
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this is.

828
02:31:06.790 --> 02:31:32.680
SHI.42.South.06: But may I know what was the the? He? He posted something on social media, and is got some because the voice was so well was a bit like a buffalo. what was the situation? It's a it's a kind of trouble policy change, or it's that it's some unfair to even from from the hotel.

829
02:31:33.210 --> 02:31:57.819
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: No, he didn't post any social media message. I I had a concern was not about a huge yeah, I mean, there's so hotel stuff. We say, hey, look at those. Pcg, they're they're they're the third team.

830
02:31:57.820 --> 02:32:07.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But they they come to us several times, you know, saying that we are not.

831
02:32:07.890 --> 02:32:13.520
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We should show. Basically.

832
02:32:19.780 --> 02:32:21.490
Rina Su: Yeah, thank you.

833
02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:34.319
Rina Su: So sorry, I would say, if that's the case. If that's a really case that this seems like the notorious and Chanel bad case, it's I would really suggest. We put him on her on the what she will tell this. Now you've a that, to be honest.

834
02:32:35.130 --> 02:32:39.819
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, I think. because I'm I'm on the Shan High Advisory Board.

835
02:32:39.890 --> 02:32:41.889
SHI.42.South.06: He is also on the Advisory Board.

836
02:32:42.060 --> 02:33:02.800
SHI.42.South.06: and and it's quite weird that the first time we have a meeting you spent like 30 min trying to give us a suggestion of how to add more Coca-cola and and both different types of drinks. And but maybe than any wants to. have global package pay. I mean, like, he raised a lot of questions. That is nothing to do with Advisory board.

837
02:33:02.950 --> 02:33:29.289
SHI.42.South.06: And apparently there's not everything that we can address, so I didn't know that he has so many complaints on on hotel, but it seems like he's a little bit. I think we should give him a message saying that we cannot address every needs from you.

838
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:32.219
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

839
02:33:32.390 --> 02:33:33.680
Yue Hong Zhang: yeah.

840
02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:40.890
Yue Hong Zhang: yeah. I think it looks like, you know it's what I'm hearing from the committee. It looked like it's not a one of incidents.

841
02:33:41.320 --> 02:34:00.939
Yue Hong Zhang: right? So if it's a one of things, maybe like it's it's basically like, something that can be passed away right? It seems like here, it's quite systematic, right at multiple occasion. He's a internally right with committee or always, or Ctnbst stuff, or it's tunnel with hotel. There is a bit of like Bcg value

842
02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:14.799
Yue Hong Zhang: issues right? And it's which are not maybe directly related to the performance. We, even though I it's it's it's part of it, but seems to be quite systematic. So just wondering from a CD point of view if we had this type of

843
02:34:15.020 --> 02:34:18.669
Yue Hong Zhang: past experience. And what's the best way forward?

844
02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:33.159
Yue Hong Zhang: But I tend to agree with Rina. I think you know it's a it's a if it's a if it's a if it's a case of of of BC value right? It's it's maybe like, you know, almost like the a char

845
02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:36.640
Yue Hong Zhang: discussion. Right? So how do we deal with this type of situation?

846
02:34:38.500 --> 02:35:00.029
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for even some

847
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:09.080
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: actually.

848
02:35:12.170 --> 02:35:21.180
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I guess we're proposing a reflex for such a hybrid We want to hear it.

849
02:35:21.470 --> 02:35:24.699
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: What is the committee? Think on that?

850
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:48.059
SHI.42.South.06: The Soviets? what you are at least overcharged. So we are seeing Red Record background household with Soviet different views. And that will come back to. I mean, I didn't have you guys as input, before, I just observed a little bit. I was a little bit confused about its behavior. But now I have a bigger picture of of this guy. So I think it's the same because it's a systematic

851
02:35:48.230 --> 02:36:00.549
SHI.42.South.06: behavior. If we really want to change, maybe I will have a problem preferred a more formal kind message.

852
02:36:00.550 --> 02:36:22.599
SHI.42.South.06: It's not the official. Only watch out to the the official 1. 8. So there's only one which is so, what's that? That's but for this case, if we say but flat and how? How? How you include like next 3 months, if there's no hotel and you're all the

853
02:36:22.850 --> 02:36:34.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay

854
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:58.130
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and the home package right in the past that they think we only evaluate the case.

855
02:36:58.490 --> 02:37:02.479
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think it should be.

856
02:37:03.760 --> 02:37:10.359
Yue Hong Zhang: I think I'm I'm very supportive to that. And I think, you know, it's more fundamental. Right? So if imagine if everyone behaved like that

857
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:30.699
Yue Hong Zhang: right, and that would actually be eroding, actually, quite a lot of of the internal culture, but also, like all value proposition to to the future. Higher, right? I think, you know, that's I mean the impact. It's not about just that specific incident. And that's specific hotel that doesn't like BC, genuine. I think it's

858
02:37:30.730 --> 02:37:38.509
Yue Hong Zhang: it's a, it's, it's a, it's a wide impact right? And whether we should where we draw the the red line. So I'm supportive to the, to the form, one decision

859
02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:40.310
Yue Hong Zhang: to the former warning.

860
02:37:40.750 --> 02:38:04.389
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, so that's put on left back. And to be fair and very clear. All your home. he is not that bizarre or not, with that that much attitude to our internal team, mostly to external our vendors, and internally, only the the things we mentioned that he is quite demanding on things.

861
02:38:04.390 --> 02:38:14.859
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That is not a trend that we want to see. So just to be clear. in case that he is arguing with us, I I'm not mean to any of our internal stuff.

862
02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:37.899
Yue Hong Zhang: Okay, that's very clear. So I'll communicate the message that you know, performance is going well, right? But actually, like we've heard concern about Bcg values. And and you know, like, that's that's that's something that we have reactively deteriorates about and then going forward for him. I think you know I'm not sure the way he

863
02:38:37.910 --> 02:38:43.990
Yue Hong Zhang: we should review it, but I think you know we should communicate that message that you know we should see a significant improvement. Right?

864
02:38:45.800 --> 02:38:56.850
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright sorry. Just one quick question. So when we talk about his attitude towards external vendor, just wondering where the information source is When we heard about that.

865
02:38:57.420 --> 02:39:00.839
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I will heard that from the Hotel Group

866
02:39:01.900 --> 02:39:07.370
Lin An: Hotel Group, so this hotel directly talk with us complaining. This

867
02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:08.840
Lin An: associate.

868
02:39:09.090 --> 02:39:22.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: they give us feedback. So it's 3 different hotel, skip a feedback on the similar things and draw attention to us. So there's a one more associate we're gonna talk about. We are also surprised to get

869
02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:36.259
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay to our travel team right

870
02:39:37.410 --> 02:39:42.669
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to at least that for now.

871
02:39:43.710 --> 02:39:53.940
Lin An: Sorry your voice a bit too far away. So I I mean, the complaint is to our travel team right? And we an ABC. As a DC. We got information from travel team right

872
02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.840
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Now, the complaint directly to us

873
02:39:58.690 --> 02:40:01.530
Lin An: who can come directly to Idc.

874
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:05.180
Lin An: okay.

875
02:40:05.450 --> 02:40:06.879
Raymond Tsui: Got it?

876
02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:15.479
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright. shall we move to the next one. yeah.

877
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:20.910
Zhigang Shi: Okay, can. He is the is the

878
02:40:20.930 --> 02:40:33.750
Zhigang Shi: associate that I spent the most of time for this review cycle. So first of all in terms of a preliminary promotion assessment for from I for promotion. I think she's not there yet.

879
02:40:34.010 --> 02:40:36.409
Zhigang Shi: And I also got very

880
02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:44.739
Zhigang Shi:  I would say a little bit mixed up feedback. Let's first talk about the Ddk's

881
02:40:45.020 --> 02:41:14.609
Zhigang Shi: and she worked on George's case. And also yeah, Hong is also the Mdp. so I guess first of all, tenth style she like the worklife balance. she she she he didn't like to really walk into, and 120'clock but But what that? The case I think for her the working always been longer but and also in terms of the content, is with the new and challenge to her.

882
02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:21.580
Zhigang Shi: But the the more important thing is her added to the toward it. Right? So the way she talked to the pl.

883
02:41:22.030 --> 02:41:41.430
Zhigang Shi: she said something like, okay, this is something that I can do. Okay, if you ask me to do that. you should aware. Expect that you have. I will hand it over to you, maybe one week later, and then you have to work you yourself, the Pl. Have to rework, or you know all, all let's say to be more hands on that.

884
02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:44.120
Zhigang Shi: and also things like.

885
02:41:44.160 --> 02:41:53.659
Zhigang Shi: oh, this pipe sector is really tough in the long working, I will. And you shouldn't now work here in the

886
02:41:53.680 --> 02:42:07.290
Zhigang Shi: I think that's something really really weird and and rare to hear from the associate, and it's just very, very defensive. in some of the conversation with the Pr. Directly, all the even with the team discussion.

887
02:42:07.460 --> 02:42:11.930
Zhigang Shi: and so that's the feedback from the type case.

888
02:42:11.950 --> 02:42:34.200
Zhigang Shi: and also right after the pap case, she worked on one day Bd for another pack of pl Gavin. I also talked to him. so it seems like tinking cannot understand what she needs to do, and after just one day, or you, let's say the half day, and then the pay I'll give up her in the finance as a candidate to support.

889
02:42:35.280 --> 02:42:44.399
Zhigang Shi: and after that she move on to my case. and to be fair, I think, in terms of deliveries

890
02:42:44.600 --> 02:42:56.030
Zhigang Shi: in terms of the client communication. I think she's okay. But also I noticed that she is very defensive in. In

891
02:42:56.150 --> 02:43:05.289
Zhigang Shi: in her discussion with the pel Also, sometimes when we have a team discussion, she just said, Okay, I don't understand what you're talking about.

892
02:43:05.430 --> 02:43:07.289
Zhigang Shi: You might. You might be

893
02:43:07.340 --> 02:43:13.210
Zhigang Shi: need to be more specifically down. Lay out what you're talking. I feel like I.

894
02:43:13.270 --> 02:43:26.330
Zhigang Shi: If she needs more respect, you know a show, more respect to the Pl. And you don't need to, you know. Crash the the the pl's credibility in front of the whole team. We can hold it as your private conversation now. You can do it much better way

895
02:43:27.390 --> 02:43:32.669
Zhigang Shi: So in that. and therefore also, you know, talk

896
02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:35.659
Zhigang Shi: with Stephanie. She I get because

897
02:43:35.670 --> 02:43:44.520
Zhigang Shi: Stefy is the the in in in Dv. Who spends most of time with tent and oh.

898
02:43:44.610 --> 02:43:50.290
Zhigang Shi: reflecting on all a career development paths.

899
02:43:50.480 --> 02:43:59.659
Zhigang Shi: I would say, it's a bit spoiled, you know she thinks that she is a good consultant will stop, and everybody wants to, but in reality it is not.

900
02:43:59.670 --> 02:44:17.830
Zhigang Shi: And the other day there is a conversation regarding whether dB, would like to, you know. after that, you know, this accountant program continue to keep her in TV and and the the the decision that was made by Stefi. And

901
02:44:18.190 --> 02:44:20.409
Zhigang Shi: show you is that

902
02:44:20.940 --> 02:44:22.760
Zhigang Shi: we don't really, you know.

903
02:44:22.810 --> 02:44:26.549
Zhigang Shi: see a strong need to to keep her.

904
02:44:26.780 --> 02:44:34.180
Zhigang Shi: and also because of the long, long term I would say her call consulting skills are not there.

905
02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:54.579
Zhigang Shi: I talked to the pl she walked with in Saudi Arabia, and their their feedback was also the same, even though the scores, too, right? So you can see that over the case. So her common something with that in terms of breakdown issues into me. See?

906
02:44:54.740 --> 02:45:03.030
Zhigang Shi: dimensions and also drive. Try to drop things, as rather just put it, abstract together. She is not there yet.

907
02:45:03.390 --> 02:45:13.480
Zhigang Shi: and also surprisingly The Pl. Tells me that this is she have to spend. She have to ask one consultant just to fix her grammatic issues

908
02:45:13.810 --> 02:45:16.000
Zhigang Shi: right? Because Kenya has.

909
02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:26.400
Zhigang Shi: yeah, because Cindy has oversee. I think she has a special degree of from the Us. If I remember that correctly. But that that's that's also all right.

910
02:45:26.810 --> 02:45:32.920
Zhigang Shi: surprising to me. So I think overall. The message to her is that

911
02:45:33.050 --> 02:45:50.030
Zhigang Shi: she might think she's a group good, the staff performer, but not. She's not there yet, and there's a lot of things to improve one from the core consulting Field the me see, thinking that the pyramid, thinking the insights, the problem solving, and also the on the things is to really

912
02:45:50.040 --> 02:45:53.869
Zhigang Shi: to to show some respect to the pl

913
02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:57.489
Zhigang Shi: I think that's that's that's the key message I want to do back to her. Yeah.

914
02:45:58.850 --> 02:46:05.550
Yue Hong Zhang: yeah, I would like to. So basically I walk. I mean, I was supervising the case in the middle of the adventures right? And I think

915
02:46:05.600 --> 02:46:14.839
Yue Hong Zhang: to be honest, I can all we we thought about stacking her, as I say, right, and, as you know, I can in a, in A, in a project as a route. But

916
02:46:15.120 --> 02:46:20.640
Yue Hong Zhang: it's a relatively important role right within, within actually, the team. Right? That's popular.

917
02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:27.679
Yue Hong Zhang: and I mean we were. It's the first time actually to be honest. We wrote off

918
02:46:27.780 --> 02:46:30.090
Yue Hong Zhang: a senior associate on the case

919
02:46:30.660 --> 02:46:36.499
Yue Hong Zhang: right in the sense of like, you know, West 10 your id. So we're actually surprised by the gap of

920
02:46:36.650 --> 02:46:48.879
Yue Hong Zhang: of poor consulting scares right on that side. And obviously I you know sometimes I. The reasons are not easy because it's a. It's different industries. I stand profile. But you know, like basic consulting scares are the same

921
02:46:49.230 --> 02:47:15.069
Yue Hong Zhang: as a strategy case. And I think now that's that's a point that's surprising for us, right? I've never had this situation where actually, I I actually had to run off a a say, especially during a deals and skills where the time short. So the trade off is to to get someone else right with with maybe less tenure, and and ramping up again on the project. So that's I think that's that's the first one right? Second point I since I I totally reflect on the attitude issue. I think that's

922
02:47:15.240 --> 02:47:17.980
Yue Hong Zhang: that's that's also to be honest, very, very

923
02:47:18.160 --> 02:47:24.450
Yue Hong Zhang: rare at BC, right? And it's It's a it's I think you know it's

924
02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:41.919
Yue Hong Zhang: I I mean the the the thing is I you know. it's not just about accepting, only ours is, you know, it's just a string that the single person with the team. And just I say, Oh, this is it? Why, you take it all or leave it right? So there is actually, I think, a big attitude issue right on how you basically

925
02:47:42.130 --> 02:47:51.790
Yue Hong Zhang: can integrate into a team. And maybe like, you know, if you have personal commitment, you can communicate and try to manage. But you know, like just being a solo players when

926
02:47:52.090 --> 02:48:05.590
Yue Hong Zhang: the team is taking the hit. If you basically get all that. I think that's that's a bit of a of an attitude issue, right? I've been pricing. So I thing is you know, I I was actually astonished that you know, when we roll it off right

927
02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:09.580
Yue Hong Zhang: She also came to to the Pl. And

928
02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:24.400
Yue Hong Zhang: and directly told him, hey, you know, like you might not be happy with my performance. But you know, please make sure I get the distance. Call right. You cannot put me on long distance call right? So it's also like the way the attitude of

929
02:48:24.450 --> 02:48:36.829
Yue Hong Zhang: you know, like a fitting entitle of of of a performance recognition under that. It's it's something to be honest. I've I've I've already seen in my in my BC. Career right since joining 10 years ago.

930
02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:39.010
Yue Hong Zhang: It's it's something. I also want to.

931
02:48:41.770 --> 02:48:59.760
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, so what would you propose to go? I pay 2 issues. So what is is the like the self awareness. And then people, it's okay. It's not that strong. But like, there's an a gap from which what she, he or she

932
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:07.090
SHI.42.South.06: she believes. yeah, okay. And the otherwise

933
02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:10.810
SHI.42.South.06: in terms of the some pushing.

934
02:49:11.970 --> 02:49:14.490
Zhigang Shi: it's either a watch out

935
02:49:16.910 --> 02:49:18.230
Zhigang Shi: or a

936
02:49:18.460 --> 02:49:22.009
Zhigang Shi: yeah. If you want to go a bit of other. Then we can go

937
02:49:22.030 --> 02:49:23.169
Zhigang Shi: into a ref by

938
02:49:25.710 --> 02:49:27.470
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and

939
02:49:27.610 --> 02:49:28.370
else.

940
02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:33.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So so for the attitude issue,

941
02:49:34.300 --> 02:49:39.500
SHI.42.South.06: what? What? What? I actually help that?

942
02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:41.660
Zhigang Shi: Yeah, watch out.

943
02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:52.239
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, that was a question. So what? What out? How would that attitude issue? If not, then she might need a reflex.

944
02:49:57.010 --> 02:49:57.890
Zhigang Shi: Yeah.

945
02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:07.619
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think she is the aware of this, if you not. I think maybe it's better to be

946
02:50:07.630 --> 02:50:08.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for

947
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:17.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: some visual wording rather than you know just the which have to be careful. I think she's already on another screen. How 3 licenses

948
02:50:27.610 --> 02:50:29.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we need to give our official

949
02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:33.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for me if I check it to the issue, though it's very

950
02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:36.019
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah. I'm very well.

951
02:50:47.420 --> 02:50:57.669
Zhigang Shi: Yeah. We'll definitely encourage your message in the posted discussion. When but when you say that official warning, do you think there's something coming from an in a trial letter?

952
02:50:59.470 --> 02:51:09.269
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: well, well, you you could call it a later. But it's an email saying that you are officially on raft flag, which is a

953
02:51:09.410 --> 02:51:11.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: one official performance warning.

954
02:51:13.550 --> 02:51:26.710
SHI.42.South.06: Would it not be a bit tough? I think a lot of times when it's like that for the cell phone.

955
02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:51.359
SHI.42.South.06: I I think for for for the self Award is a lot of times even even if doesn't feel very comfortable when she says, you should give me better that you should, you should no way of doing. But I think Pl. For for a lot of times when you're getting down the right saying you need to really correct your position and also self awareness.

956
02:51:51.360 --> 02:52:07.289
SHI.42.South.06: so I think a message from the from the from the ABC. Or from from the city advice. It will probably be enough right. It's probably gonna be tough for red flag at this stage to that right.

957
02:52:08.470 --> 02:52:37.820
SHI.42.South.06: I think, for some something. The the the pl might not be a cocaine, or might not be a very well to communicate that. But some of the DC. I think her her major problem with that of like the wider reception of for itself. so for that, I think. what? Yeah. Well, well, I I just cannot imagine that they that a A or C on a team telling the Pr. That, hey? If you let me do this.

958
02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:45.160
Kay Tang: you're gonna receive something really bad, and you need to fix it yourself. Is that something that we should tolerance

959
02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:56.660
SHI.42.South.06: all the an install message. On what account? Right is that if there's still no pro lesbian to put our own?

960
02:52:57.140 --> 02:53:05.829
Kay Tang: I I mean, I mean, if if I see if a aoc on the team saying this to the Pr. She, she or she obviously know the consequence. Right.

961
02:53:08.120 --> 02:53:09.690
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: for

962
02:53:12.940 --> 02:53:26.239
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think he observed some clear, you know, score treating, or even, you know, something like a threat to the I think it's quite a quite a serious behavior issue. Right?

963
02:53:27.480 --> 02:53:31.959
Yue Hong Zhang: I agree. Be honest, it's it's quite exceptional, right? So it's

964
02:53:32.040 --> 02:53:43.770
Yue Hong Zhang: It's a I don't know what's the the right to that, but it's it's it's I would even say it's a it's almost like a a behavior by team play issue.

965
02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:48.150
Yue Hong Zhang: outside of performance. I I I I'm not sure how all those situations are treated.

966
02:53:52.510 --> 02:53:55.759
SHI.42.South.06: but that shouldn't be a roughly. should it?

967
02:53:56.100 --> 02:53:58.179
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Why, it shouldn't be a that.

968
02:53:59.400 --> 02:54:06.770
SHI.42.South.06: All this different communication stuff and different people, some some people it is very outspoken. And

969
02:54:06.950 --> 02:54:16.169
SHI.42.South.06: well, just right right now it's like it. Also, I I don't think this. Is there any previous communication, or where we're still wearing from the P. Out to her

970
02:54:16.830 --> 02:54:22.500
SHI.42.South.06: all that if there's no strong work that she probably think oh, it's probably just the way it works.

971
02:54:23.490 --> 02:54:34.330
SHI.42.South.06: And Also, I I've heard a lot of times while the downwards communication can be very tough, and there's no reflex, or on that right.

972
02:54:35.620 --> 02:54:44.559
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: What we decide is we should look at the behaviors and the nature of the issue, and decide whether it's serious not to be a red black.

973
02:54:44.600 --> 02:55:04.440
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: We do. We should give a red that not because of the downward as a tool, and because it was a nice pier. So it's it's another issue I have to resolve right? It's a consistent issue. We do observe some inconsistency in terms of giving down our scores, and also what we've heard from.

974
02:55:04.450 --> 02:55:29.749
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because, he does. Later, when we discuss some specific associate issues, we even see that the you can start to be, you know, afraid of but saying the truth about the because some of some of the agencies are just so, you know they they don't demanding, or they they make right now some of in some of the cases making the cheese because they're not afraid of having the.

975
02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:52.819
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So what culture we're promoting here? If ABC, we've heard the truth on the meeting, we should do the right thing, but it's of the consistent issue. We need to tell them. You know the the chooses, the the you know you. You have the issues, not because of the nice. Yeah, they're not there to get the

976
02:55:54.630 --> 02:56:17.490
Yue Hong Zhang: yeah, I'm supportive of, I think that's a that's a that's a very valid point. And that's basically the message that we're sending right? The culture that we're promoting. And we actually building a culture of like black naming each other and say, Hey, you know I'm going to say that you're not a good Pr. And bring your reputation if there is no like, you know. Good you know protection towards my score, etc. Right? That's not what we want to encourage.

977
02:56:19.200 --> 02:56:20.750
Zhigang Shi: Yeah, I'm supporting that as well.

978
02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:25.230
SHI.42.South.06: Good.

979
02:56:25.330 --> 02:56:31.000
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright, so I'm hearing that we are protein, can he? ref like.

980
02:56:32.370 --> 02:56:33.180
SHI.42.South.06: right?

981
02:56:33.530 --> 02:56:37.489
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright. Let's move to the next one.

982
02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:41.550
Michelle Ma: Hello! Can you hear me?

983
02:56:41.760 --> 02:57:00.650
Michelle Ma: I think. yeah, luckily we have a positive case now. So after 2, you never negative case in general, Monica is performing over consistently. So she is doing well. If we look at all the numbers. I think it's a much above average So availability is good.

984
02:57:00.650 --> 02:57:25.870
Michelle Ma: And every call is is okay. So I think over. I I walk them with Monica together, too, I assume. So she's a very detailed. I ran to the person, and she's a frame. It's always expect the a reliable quality in terms of the delivery from her. and if look at the number of her 8 co-fil, she's also very consistent getting her to all once. So I think she has a very typical

985
02:57:25.870 --> 02:57:48.490
Michelle Ma: and like PC. To home, growing a very solid, a consulting skill, and a deeper oriented this kind of a personality, and in terms of a gap. I think that's also very clear that she is a little bit of quiet in terms of communication, both internal and and externally. And so when that led her and talk to other peers to, we try to encourage it to be

986
02:57:48.490 --> 02:58:00.929
Michelle Ma: more aggressive. Speak out to speak loud, and don't be afraid of challenge this kind of a I think she is improving, but that still. I think a little bit gaps to my expectation.

987
02:58:00.930 --> 02:58:12.980
Michelle Ma: of course it's based on for personality and and and and nature of character. So she is doing this time to improve there. But overall I think it's a very positive

988
02:58:13.150 --> 02:58:24.439
Michelle Ma: a profile. definitely, I think she is beyond the bg, average quality very staffable, but also not to the top one. So

989
02:58:24.520 --> 02:58:36.650
Michelle Ma: from this kind of observation. I would say she is a in my point of issues at 12 but in between 12 and a 15 month profile, and we can definitely decide on our next cycle.

990
02:58:36.790 --> 02:58:37.510
Michelle Ma: Yeah.

991
02:58:39.070 --> 02:58:48.309
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, I'm the same essay as well. Let's move to the next one. Nicholas.

992
02:58:51.790 --> 02:58:56.380
Nicholas Ge: Hello! This is Nicholas. Yes, oh, young

993
02:58:56.740 --> 02:59:02.820
Nicholas Ge: continuously did a very good job at a latest. Co. It.

994
02:59:02.830 --> 02:59:24.900
Nicholas Ge: So he she! She finished with the case on G, and the recently she also worked with the Tmt. On a due diligence case. I I talked to the Pl. The Plo. Gave her a very high recognition, and they actually the Pl. Wanted to give her a raking. What for the calibration purpose that was collaborated into 2.

995
02:59:24.900 --> 02:59:42.210
Nicholas Ge: And he not only excel the across all those I mean dimensions, including the problem solving client interaction, and and the and the and the and and and and and and and and and and and the and and and and the and and and and and and and and the and the and and and and and and and and and the and and and and and and and and and and and and and the and the and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the and the and the and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the and the and the and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the and the and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the and the and the and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and the and the and and and and and and

996
02:59:42.580 --> 02:59:58.040
Nicholas Ge: a lady with a very strong characteristics. So the team really enjoyed to work with her. so so I I think that you are really on the right track as a senior associate.

997
02:59:58.410 --> 03:00:00.619
Nicholas Ge: So she's the

998
03:00:00.710 --> 03:00:07.629
Nicholas Ge: 7, 17 months, 10, you at a I say. So I as soon as she she she's quite okay for now.

999
03:00:09.500 --> 03:00:22.480
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: just to remind her that the Sp. Hasn't been punished. So we encourage to finish that as soon as possible.

1000
03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:30.059
Nicholas Ge: Oh, okay, okay, okay, but she she she I I think she she she finished this, she is now on Lulu Labo.

1001
03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:33.450
Nicholas Ge: Okay, okay, that that one. Yes, yes.

1002
03:00:33.700 --> 03:00:48.409
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also hopefully, that's too. I know it's already being calibrated. But hopefully, we can get, you can further calibrate so that he is not effective. during the promotion.

1003
03:00:50.910 --> 03:01:12.459
Nicholas Ge: That's good. That didn't get that it. You. You mean it's a calibration that you'd be confirmed about. You. Turn it right? So it's already confirmed. But you chance over all very high in the collaboration score. So if he continue to be that high, I see. Okay. So so there's a potential to be further calibrated from 1, 2, 3

1004
03:01:12.850 --> 03:01:22.499
Nicholas Ge: not for the, but for their influence, because we are actually counting those.

1005
03:01:23.220 --> 03:01:27.139
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright Next one is she pay, and just

1006
03:01:28.590 --> 03:01:30.930
SHI.42.South.06: no to.

1007
03:01:31.150 --> 03:01:45.189
SHI.42.South.06: So they they actually, it's quite well she was on like the image for a long time, and then, the feedback is is good. So she was a strong phone or noted

1008
03:01:45.250 --> 03:01:48.620
SHI.42.South.06: I think this time.

1009
03:01:48.990 --> 03:02:05.560
SHI.42.South.06: considering for a very high credibility, and also a good feedback she deserves a like predecessor.

1010
03:02:29.070 --> 03:02:40.939
SHI.42.South.06: it might not response. It's a good case but we don't need to confirm. She's only 8 months. So we need to control now. Yeah.

1011
03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:42.969
SHI.42.South.06: on good check.

1012
03:02:44.270 --> 03:02:48.579
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you.

1013
03:02:48.790 --> 03:03:01.860
Lin An: Sure. so it's a quite a strong performer. we're quite well balanced strong analytics. also, have a good interaction with client.

1014
03:03:02.040 --> 03:03:17.410
Lin An: see, the score is very high for him this tenure. but he's I think he's going to Mba from July. So for 2 years, so I guess he's a promotion discussion will now happen until he's back.

1015
03:03:17.600 --> 03:03:18.920
Lin An: that's what I'll yeah.

1016
03:03:21.320 --> 03:03:44.570
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Thank you.

1017
03:04:01.110 --> 03:04:17.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: overall. I checked the part 8 plus. We actually was on project all the time. But actually, probably the

1018
03:04:17.630 --> 03:04:18.910
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay.

1019
03:04:19.080 --> 03:04:26.890
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay. Thanks. Oh, that was a clear one as well, So we move to the next one for them.

1020
03:04:27.980 --> 03:04:28.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Jeffrey.

1021
03:04:29.450 --> 03:04:34.519
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: Right? So, Brian. it's doing quite well.

1022
03:04:34.540 --> 03:05:00.060
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: So a couple of tools on 2 recent projects. One is for Johnny and then another one is, why is case so like different practice, you know, here, both positive feedback in terms of communications, and also find the pandemic execution. So when I say some feedback in terms of, he could be more proactively driving modules But although he is doing well

1023
03:05:00.110 --> 03:05:04.879
HKG.37.111.GreatWall: but I think it's short to discuss promotion, but it is on the right hand.

1024
03:05:06.450 --> 03:05:08.160
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright. Thanks.

1025
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:16.710
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so I I know that we're in this back Would you like to talk on Yvonne?

1026
03:05:17.250 --> 03:05:24.309
Raymond Tsui: Yeah. Yvonne has. I mean, she's nearly finishing her as a common at she. Now I think it's ending this month

1027
03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:36.569
Raymond Tsui: she has been there for the past half year, and I've heard a positive feedback overall from the client, right? But given, this is a common. I don't think it's evaluative so to speak.

1028
03:05:36.700 --> 03:05:43.909
Raymond Tsui: but once she's back, I think she should be kept right on track to perform as a good essay.

1029
03:05:48.730 --> 03:05:51.270
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: this and

1030
03:05:51.350 --> 03:05:55.430
Raymond Tsui: that's one

1031
03:05:55.470 --> 03:06:06.600
Raymond Tsui: be continues to perform extremely well on and way if you look at the availability is slipper high adding value on the different modules and work streams on Amway.

1032
03:06:06.690 --> 03:06:31.480
Raymond Tsui: And I think she's quite well rounded strongly multiple dimensions, right? she's only 8 months right now. so maybe a bit early to tell the final timeline, right? But I I think if she continues the performance, and if she sort of gets a one on the next case, right? I think. next, Cy, what we can discuss, whether it's worth the 12 month

1033
03:06:31.540 --> 03:06:33.409
Raymond Tsui: promotion window.

1034
03:06:39.150 --> 03:06:43.969
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And this is back right? Can we talk on. Laura's

1035
03:06:44.750 --> 03:06:57.789
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, Laura's is quite straightforward, and he's definitely a start, a performer for viral. And her feedback. Was I consistent?

1036
03:06:57.820 --> 03:07:11.610
SHI.42.South.06: Obviously outstanding in problem, solving being ownership in Kai's contribution, and in almost each dimension. The only thing is that he needs to strengthen.

1037
03:07:11.610 --> 03:07:34.770
SHI.42.South.06: his, you know. client interaction with the senior management level. This is the only comment of development area feedback from the from D Ppl, I guess the Loris is also very fungible. he has been working on the auto cases, the Cg consumer goose cases.

1038
03:07:34.920 --> 03:07:45.920
SHI.42.South.06: and the availability is a part high. So I guess he's definitely a top month promotion for Pyro. But we can fully confirm it in the next cycle.

1039
03:07:47.300 --> 03:07:55.940
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Well, thanks, Travis. again. I' we can get going to for the category. So that is for one, the

1040
03:07:56.080 --> 03:07:59.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'll show as as inflated next time.

1041
03:08:00.720 --> 03:08:01.590
SHI.42.South.06: Sure.

1042
03:08:02.260 --> 03:08:08.560
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Alright! I think we finish all the preliminary review for

1043
03:08:08.670 --> 03:08:10.250
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: essay

1044
03:08:10.380 --> 03:08:16.640
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: before going to.

1045
03:08:30.780 --> 03:08:34.509
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So here we have,

1046
03:08:34.730 --> 03:08:45.140
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also one more up for a preliminary review student. Any questions

1047
03:08:50.230 --> 03:08:52.939
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: you is on the comments.

1048
03:08:53.600 --> 03:08:55.530
SHI.42.South.06: okay, yeah.

1049
03:08:58.380 --> 03:09:02.200
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right. So shall we move to?

1050
03:09:03.370 --> 03:09:04.340
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yes.

1051
03:09:04.900 --> 03:09:07.480
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that section. But

1052
03:09:07.700 --> 03:09:10.790
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: let's do reflex and watch out. For as a

1053
03:09:11.910 --> 03:09:15.800
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the first one is the imam. because.

1054
03:09:20.060 --> 03:09:23.949
Nicholas Ge: hey, Hello, yeah. So this is Nicole.

1055
03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:29.909
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Honest, we cannot hear you.

1056
03:09:46.190 --> 03:09:50.550
Nicholas Ge: Yeah, let's move to the next one

1057
03:09:55.290 --> 03:09:57.839
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: a bit. Better a little bit.

1058
03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:12.049
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Maybe maybe we we could go to next one first and maybe you can find somewhere with better.

1059
03:10:12.140 --> 03:10:14.210
Nicholas Ge: How are you? Okay? Hello.

1060
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:15.620
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yes.

1061
03:10:16.450 --> 03:10:43.469
Nicholas Ge: okay, okay. So so even though, last time we said that the email need to work on the Ipa is other than Ig, so she waited on the beach for quite a while, and eventually she was still on one insurance case for 3 weeks. regarding that a particular case. Actually, that feedback is applied to. Okay, the performance is good. And then

1062
03:10:44.010 --> 03:11:02.339
Nicholas Ge: but in parallel we also last time, why, we put her on the reflex, because there's a lot of feedback saying that her attitude for Vd is somehow very different from her attitude on on case.

1063
03:11:02.450 --> 03:11:11.269
Nicholas Ge: and this time we have cost to spend some time to observe how did they see in crew in terms of vd support.

1064
03:11:11.330 --> 03:11:19.219
Nicholas Ge: honestly, they are still different reviews regarding her performance on on vds

1065
03:11:19.250 --> 03:11:32.199
Nicholas Ge: a couple of PP, I thought that She is a good and very active. and there some are also quite committed, but they are also 2 Ppl. provided with quite a negative feedback.

1066
03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:35.600
Nicholas Ge: actually, the one people. I said that that

1067
03:11:35.670 --> 03:11:52.939
Nicholas Ge: that the emails, the attitude. first of all, it is very difficult to find the email. And it's a difficult to contact her the get get get in contact efficiently. And second.

1068
03:11:55.880 --> 03:12:11.470
Nicholas Ge: a and this a vp, I also said that when the Pr they find them email. And just to put it all those those, those, those those those awardings into a very simple and a rough template. Then,

1069
03:12:11.550 --> 03:12:21.810
Nicholas Ge: she didn't do any fine tune and the the adjustment, and and then send back the the the both the slides to the Pdf.

1070
03:12:21.940 --> 03:12:27.560
Nicholas Ge: And so the PP, I'll hold an email that she

1071
03:12:27.630 --> 03:12:36.639
Nicholas Ge: don't believe this. This is the quality from a

1072
03:12:37.250 --> 03:12:38.670
Nicholas Ge: Canada.

1073
03:12:41.500 --> 03:12:53.349
Nicholas Ge: she's not a satisfied 4 monthly improved. I mean, yeah. So so this is basically the situation. So so so basically regarding being shot regarding the Bb support.

1074
03:12:53.490 --> 03:13:04.270
Nicholas Ge: yeah. As I said, that they are still concerns about your for attitude and the the quality. But however, couple of people also said that she is okay.

1075
03:13:05.700 --> 03:13:07.879
Nicholas Ge: Okay. So this is what I

1076
03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:13.749
Nicholas Ge: I collect for Imam's performance in.

1077
03:13:13.900 --> 03:13:17.160
Nicholas Ge: I see any, any, any other.

1078
03:13:19.270 --> 03:13:21.120
Nicholas Ge: any comments from the group

1079
03:13:30.460 --> 03:13:31.580
to me.

1080
03:13:31.860 --> 03:13:39.800
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So just to recall everyone. this is exactly the same issue we encountered last cycle

1081
03:13:39.820 --> 03:13:48.399
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: so good in case work, but attitude and quality issue in Bd work for several complaints. And then

1082
03:13:48.570 --> 03:13:53.720
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: actually, this continue to go on like 2 more pl's complaints

1083
03:13:54.250 --> 03:14:04.880
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to be honest with reality. Rarely see people complained by 2 pl. not to mention like this is consecutive in many pls

1084
03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:08.349
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and For that reason.

1085
03:14:08.640 --> 03:14:13.059
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'll suggest that this keep him. Keep her on rough, that

1086
03:14:14.990 --> 03:14:23.020
SHI.42.South.06: my only concern is that we can keep our own reflex. or if this climate is also a reflection, and that means it's a Ct.

1087
03:14:23.950 --> 03:14:26.910
SHI.42.South.06: it's not a CPU, it's it's continuing roughly.

1088
03:14:27.460 --> 03:14:38.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the the I have to say from a trial perspective. She is pregnant right now, and we we cannot do Ct decision for her.

1089
03:14:39.010 --> 03:14:56.489
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So the worst thing we can do is wrap like we're at least, or or before any further confirmation that we have to keep her on. Reflect for the worst case. The only thing is that

1090
03:14:56.500 --> 03:15:03.610
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: if this continue, then we'll still have to push her promotion every single time after.

1091
03:15:03.870 --> 03:15:06.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: If this attitude doesn't being solved.

1092
03:15:09.330 --> 03:15:10.460
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, I believe

1093
03:15:11.050 --> 03:15:11.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah.

1094
03:15:12.300 --> 03:15:33.479
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So let's put rough flag, and I know, because she is very difficult to communicate. but please still help us to deliver the message that we still receive multiple complaints. And even we receive one written feed feedback for her as she requests.

1095
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:42.179
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So hope she will really look into her issue, and not being defensive since that saying that she's not doing anything wrong.

1096
03:15:44.560 --> 03:15:46.330
Nicholas Ge: Yeah, sure. Yeah, yeah.

1097
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:48.930
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thanks to you guys.

1098
03:15:49.030 --> 03:15:51.500
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So we moved to next one. Jackson Lee.

1099
03:15:53.140 --> 03:16:02.729
Raymond Tsui: Well, yeah. So I think, Jackson, continues to perform in the health care practice right?

1100
03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:07.720
Raymond Tsui: if you look at the latest score, it has improved towards you.

1101
03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:27.700
Raymond Tsui: the you know, the the flag to me is that it's still a free in problem solving right? I think if I look at the evaluation. It's a it's saying that he, you know, he does a good job in collecting the information you know, developing his question in terms of the thinking. Huh!

1102
03:16:27.780 --> 03:16:37.480
Raymond Tsui: but the the the key thing is he? He just repeats what after the expert says, right? So I think in terms of distilling critical thinking. That's still a bit lacking.

1103
03:16:37.730 --> 03:16:50.480
Raymond Tsui: And I do not hear complaints anymore on stress management. But it does right on the evaluation that you know, he could keep a more positive attitude under stress. Right?

1104
03:16:50.680 --> 03:17:00.690
Raymond Tsui: so to me, it's a very marginal improvement versus last cycle both in terms of problems, hoping and stress management.

1105
03:17:01.680 --> 03:17:08.979
Raymond Tsui: so I think, open for discussion. Do we continue to keep on watch out, or do we? you know, move that to a roughly

1106
03:17:17.800 --> 03:17:25.150
SHI.42.South.06: I I work with him on Bb over the past month. I think my general impression is that

1107
03:17:25.640 --> 03:17:28.720
SHI.42.South.06: you, you basically a lack of training of

1108
03:17:28.870 --> 03:17:41.919
SHI.42.South.06: before. So he's not bad at problem solving. He just never seen what real problem solving it is so when, when when we explain to to him how things works, and then he'd actually get it. But it's just like never a significant one.

1109
03:17:42.140 --> 03:17:48.099
SHI.42.South.06: So I I think he might have missed his time before. But

1110
03:17:48.140 --> 03:17:51.760
SHI.42.South.06: it is what it is, so I think it's it's

1111
03:17:52.780 --> 03:18:06.000
SHI.42.South.06: but his availability is low. The the question is how to get in staff, because if I have a case, I look at his profile, I would not prefer, even though I know he might have credential. But it's too late.

1112
03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:31.000
SHI.42.South.06: I issued a single observation. I'm currently working with the and so Jackson is very committed to hard working, and so learns fast. But the question is the exposure he got. So far as I say, it's not sufficient to we start, especially in such a difficult situation, and the Denson is hired directly, as I think of your as a

1113
03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:47.860
SHI.42.South.06: but the I think it. He collects his culture to understand what is the business analytics part? So maybe. Why, my, I was thinking whether we should. How, how should we solve this? If some, whether we

1114
03:18:47.860 --> 03:18:49.600
SHI.42.South.06: at this time

1115
03:18:50.150 --> 03:19:00.669
SHI.42.South.06: in in this contest, whether it would give you or observation window to get exposure or Yeah, just so forward to to to discuss.

1116
03:19:01.020 --> 03:19:10.150
SHI.42.South.06: I've already got like 1314 months, 10 year. Right? So I to get all these exposures and experience are still.

1117
03:19:14.440 --> 03:19:28.540
Raymond Tsui: Yeah, I I tend to agree. I I can't see who was speaking in the room. But because if I look at the profile, it's a lot of healthcare cases. I I think people value his health care background. But

1118
03:19:28.890 --> 03:19:31.540
Raymond Tsui: because of this right? It's

1119
03:19:31.590 --> 03:19:49.390
Raymond Tsui: It's actually not doing him a favor in broadening him to other pas, you know, or other cases where, there will be a high requirement on business things. Right? So it's it's it's really trying. Yes, really professional. why people

1120
03:19:49.620 --> 03:19:51.879
Raymond Tsui: right? So

1121
03:19:52.420 --> 03:20:02.850
Raymond Tsui: Is this a and gift in his 10? Or is it is to the situation where we put him on reflex so that he gets the benefit of at least being free invested in some non health care cases.

1122
03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:15.249
Raymond Tsui: or even, you know, longer programs, if possible. Right? but and see whether it would help, and I think the the the task should be whether she gets a to in problems hoping next time.

1123
03:20:18.780 --> 03:20:19.610
SHI.42.South.06: Good.

1124
03:20:25.090 --> 03:20:31.250
Raymond Tsui: It's no

1125
03:20:31.660 --> 03:20:32.920
SHI.42.South.06: the

1126
03:20:33.350 --> 03:20:34.950
SHI.42.South.06: that's that

1127
03:20:36.630 --> 03:20:39.519
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: checks on. it's

1128
03:20:39.930 --> 03:20:45.359
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's yeah. It's a bit. It's difficult to to stop him. And

1129
03:20:45.780 --> 03:20:47.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but I mean,

1130
03:20:47.860 --> 03:20:53.589
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: putting him on reflex. it will be easier for us to to to.

1131
03:20:58.500 --> 03:21:00.340
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

1132
03:21:00.820 --> 03:21:06.330
SHI.42.South.06: is there any before like opportunity for texting even pass

1133
03:21:08.230 --> 03:21:13.779
SHI.42.South.06: assume so usually you do the job. And then it's like a certain months.

1134
03:21:13.830 --> 03:21:26.319
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, I mean, I mean, for like, during the spreadsheet period over the last quarter, I surgery. There is not a work that is so watch out now. So there's no

1135
03:21:26.690 --> 03:21:28.570
SHI.42.South.06: like, investment.

1136
03:21:29.920 --> 03:21:48.040
SHI.42.South.06: What? I said, okay, it's It's probably in a better for you to stay on to be in a replacement.

1137
03:21:48.720 --> 03:21:49.830
SHI.42.South.06: Understood?

1138
03:21:51.530 --> 03:21:52.630
Raymond Tsui: Okay?

1139
03:21:53.210 --> 03:21:58.079
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: What I hear from Shanghai would be put him? All reflect right.

1140
03:21:59.100 --> 03:22:00.120
SHI.42.South.06: Yes.

1141
03:22:00.230 --> 03:22:07.899
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay. all right. Moving to the next one. some are cool. Yeah. yes.

1142
03:22:09.780 --> 03:22:11.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: in summer's case

1144
03:22:49.990 --> 03:22:51.050
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: as.

1145
03:22:52.840 --> 03:22:54.040
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and she

1146
03:22:54.500 --> 03:22:55.559
by team

1147
03:22:55.570 --> 03:22:57.830
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: the.

1148
03:22:57.970 --> 03:23:10.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And again, the engagement is that we also

1149
03:23:10.910 --> 03:23:13.170
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: oh, let's see.

1150
03:23:22.090 --> 03:23:22.970
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And

1151
03:23:24.910 --> 03:23:26.770
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's actually.

1152
03:23:28.590 --> 03:23:35.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And then she got a chance to.

1153
03:23:35.300 --> 03:23:43.670
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And the this is the

1154
03:23:46.080 --> 03:23:48.740
we got. It

1155
03:23:49.800 --> 03:23:50.500
takes me.

1156
03:23:50.670 --> 03:23:51.789
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: That's pretty good.

1157
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:58.099
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: She got to the

1158
03:23:58.140 --> 03:24:13.219
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: ours has a quite positive feedback about here.

1159
03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:14.430
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and

1160
03:24:14.520 --> 03:24:16.700
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she's qualified, as

1161
03:24:16.770 --> 03:24:19.870
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: let's say or not. if there's a

1162
03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:21.890
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: one plus one is.

1163
03:24:22.830 --> 03:24:32.410
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: you want to stop her, and there is not some parrot's. If it is just packets, and the very

1164
03:24:32.800 --> 03:24:37.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: she will be not that.

1165
03:24:37.930 --> 03:24:41.789
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: And if it is a normal case, it is today

1166
03:24:41.880 --> 03:24:43.100
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: her just that.

1167
03:24:43.140 --> 03:24:48.490
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So I think it is a little bit, too.

1168
03:24:49.580 --> 03:24:54.240
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think we might need to.

1169
03:24:56.580 --> 03:25:04.320
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: we might need to think about keeping her.

1170
03:25:07.290 --> 03:25:10.390
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: He was asking. absolutely.

1171
03:25:10.540 --> 03:25:18.769
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But, really.

1172
03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:29.560
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Well, the the reason why? So we have a recent piece is a very short only like the full week.

1173
03:25:29.650 --> 03:25:37.499
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, so and that, looking at this I I don't see there's enough significance.

1174
03:25:37.630 --> 03:25:58.260
SHI.42.South.06: and you don't promise so any like the intellectual, like the insides type of thing. So the mostly well, the most important, the matrix, we look at that. And so this continue to be an issue, and then plus the Chanel the previous one, Chanel Janelle, and so also

1175
03:25:58.350 --> 03:26:07.290
SHI.42.South.06: all the way all the way through is in the street. So I think that it's a extraneous and difficult difficult to.

1176
03:26:08.140 --> 03:26:09.230
SHI.42.South.06: So

1177
03:26:09.490 --> 03:26:21.230
SHI.42.South.06: I've collaborated with summer during vd for one with me, I think, in general, is for healthcare and our our sense. And also

1178
03:26:21.230 --> 03:26:46.040
SHI.42.South.06: for some of the problems, we are actually okay. So then also I think, for current defaults, in case it's only in trim or very initial creating this for the purpose for CD meeting, right? So maybe at the end of this after the full case has been done there, the way that average.

1179
03:26:48.720 --> 03:27:04.549
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: after talking with the Pelosi she has worked with us, I think to she is qualified as a an associate. but She's doing some time to cool that that.

1180
03:27:10.270 --> 03:27:31.189
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, he's qualified as an associate. This is the essay assessment already, and then there's a divided by a quite divided V of Chanel. If you look at a scores, subscribers, all 3, and then the the current score as you mentioned, is interrupts, for by their sound like tools, but still

1181
03:27:31.220 --> 03:27:37.910
SHI.42.South.06: like I think the the clock is sticking up so already 12 months.

1182
03:27:38.120 --> 03:27:54.239
SHI.42.South.06: and that if we drag to another like a what child? And that's 3 months, and next month, yeah. And then it's still we will face the same difficult situation, like the reflex, or or or or like what child I think it's a

1183
03:27:54.610 --> 03:27:56.020
SHI.42.South.06: it's probably

1184
03:27:56.370 --> 03:28:00.969
SHI.42.South.06: reflex. Mix to time makes a it'll be easier for

1185
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:15.099
SHI.42.South.06: the opportunities and all the okay. So how long is the your case? The come on the the current? Not money. Okay? So the current is, I think it's a month and a half a month and a half, though it will end on at the beginning to

1186
03:28:17.760 --> 03:28:29.689
SHI.42.South.06: erez agmoni. So it started in April, the seventeenth. So at the beginning of the June, so pretty much running sooner afterwards, then it's we need to consider again. It's one

1187
03:28:29.960 --> 03:28:38.629
SHI.42.South.06: opportunity. Yeah, kind of makes fun of that. That's what I said, okay, coffee.

1188
03:28:39.630 --> 03:28:49.609
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: So we do anything to to to to this. she got she did gone.

1189
03:28:50.190 --> 03:28:51.020
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay.

1190
03:28:54.870 --> 03:29:03.970
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  I don't think so. I'm on the right that she saw. I say higher.

1191
03:29:05.960 --> 03:29:12.479
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: She's from Cs, not sure whether she has a tangent of the forecast.

1192
03:29:28.810 --> 03:29:51.829
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I I don't know what's where you should. I'm not sure how much I can't you. I saw the evaluation. I I didn't notice piece on the project. She's on the yeah. I'm very quiet, never! Rebecca spoke out in the in the yeah, and I talked to her as well, and she said,

1193
03:29:52.010 --> 03:30:10.180
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: She very rarely communicate to anyone proactively, even within the team, so like no one know the progress, and she's not speaking our. And also the one thing she point out is doing, and the da she is quite

1194
03:30:10.230 --> 03:30:27.189
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I expect him quite high from herself to improve asking for you to build a module for benchmark, but eventually You could notice that she cannot deliver in the perfect benchmarking work. So I guess that's that's quite some issue for essay.

1195
03:30:27.370 --> 03:30:44.400
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  yeah, I I'll feel very worried for it, for for her in the future to give and talk more tenure, and the longest one where she still have it in another 12 month. Right?

1196
03:30:44.740 --> 03:30:50.030
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: But looking at this it was still quite low, and

1197
03:30:50.070 --> 03:30:56.970
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: sp, not the yet finish, and even not hearing her voices during their cases.

1198
03:30:57.190 --> 03:31:15.129
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: actually, the disability issue has been introduced in that way.

1199
03:31:15.580 --> 03:31:18.119
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I think it is it? It is

1200
03:31:18.430 --> 03:31:21.780
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: because of her expertise, and it's

1201
03:31:25.900 --> 03:31:38.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright. I I I guess the only discussion here we we're having is whether to remain. Watch how to  Shanghai. Do you have any

1202
03:31:38.570 --> 03:31:43.420
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: any you or any others on the online? You have a view on that?

1203
03:31:44.950 --> 03:32:00.210
SHI.42.South.06: Well, it's Shawn how we discuss that as mentioned that I think we we believe this is an a case, and I also benefit would benefit her right after the current. If he's finished, then in the early early.

1204
03:32:10.500 --> 03:32:20.149
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: okay, So so that's all for the and what have we have is email

1205
03:32:20.220 --> 03:32:23.700
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: email. And Jackson, some are all on reference right now.

1206
03:32:28.010 --> 03:32:32.400
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Oh, showing up to to as a individual.

1207
03:32:36.030 --> 03:32:38.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: First one is.

1208
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:43.570
Zhigang Shi: yeah.

1209
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:57.900
Zhigang Shi: Sophie is now doing an as a kind of program investment program in South East Asia. They base it out of, you know, a Bangkok office. So I talked with her. Pl.

1210
03:32:58.740 --> 03:33:20.119
Zhigang Shi: obviously, this challenging new environment especially on the language front that. this is because everything is English. A Pr is also as a investor using an ambassador program, transferring from the Us. And but the client counterpart also is

1211
03:33:20.120 --> 03:33:34.429
Zhigang Shi: and native English speakers. So the language of obviously, is the first obstacle that she has to overcome. But I think that's the that's also one of the reason they should choose to do this as a program. the overall feedback. It was good

1212
03:33:34.460 --> 03:33:41.609
Zhigang Shi: across all the dimensions she One of the good things that we like her is that she is quite corrective.

1213
03:33:41.740 --> 03:33:49.529
Zhigang Shi: in terms of communication with the out, and try to be more iterative. making sure that she's on the right track.

1214
03:33:49.620 --> 03:33:52.740
Zhigang Shi: also that

1215
03:33:52.960 --> 03:34:03.880
Zhigang Shi: She is also a good team player. you know, in a new environment, trying to organize different team events. And and I and I think this, she's she's adapting herself very quickly

1216
03:34:03.920 --> 03:34:13.580
Zhigang Shi: into the s sc, a systems. but it is through a wrong way, and and

1217
03:34:13.790 --> 03:34:20.620
Zhigang Shi: to test it out for the rest of the program. But I think that's really, really a good experience for herself. Yeah.

1218
03:34:26.300 --> 03:34:32.310
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: thank you. going to. That's your any plus

1219
03:34:43.240 --> 03:34:43.930
cool.

1220
03:34:44.650 --> 03:35:01.619
Nicholas Ge: hey? Hey? Hello! This is Nicholas. yeah. Got in touch and judge. And recently first of all, I I I think she took one month. They are away right then after the airway, and she was the staff the

1221
03:35:01.650 --> 03:35:12.800
Nicholas Ge: a case for with with what she was said that by country And this case is still ongoing.

1222
03:35:12.880 --> 03:35:27.110
Nicholas Ge: And I checked with the tray and the tree also told me you quite positive feedback about Judge. The overall performance is still solid. Of course there is still some area for improvement as a junior essay.

1223
03:35:27.250 --> 03:35:29.340
Nicholas Ge: but a generally on tech.

1224
03:35:29.570 --> 03:35:33.540
Nicholas Ge: So nothing special to highlight.

1225
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:41.679
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Great. Thank you. my! So I'm back to you and tell me

1226
03:35:45.680 --> 03:36:01.340
Tammy Tan: Becky. I think Becky is also performing well on track. My, but she is only in 6 months only one case, as I say, so it's early to to decide. Anyway, we're on track over real well, run your skill set

1227
03:36:01.340 --> 03:36:17.579
Tammy Tan: the improved the improvement error is more of the Po feedback is she needs to enhance the men set off. really try to work very independent. And the think ahead of the pl

1228
03:36:17.580 --> 03:36:30.739
Tammy Tan: don't drive very clear line between what is what? What support what's in supposed to be Po's role? And what's the book? Things supposed to be her role? So that's the only feedback I got.

1229
03:36:33.950 --> 03:36:43.380
Tammy Tan: I also talked with with her on this issue already, but on skill side on skill. Set wise. quite, quite well around it.

1230
03:36:44.880 --> 03:36:46.440
SHI.42.South.06: Okay, yeah.

1231
03:36:46.930 --> 03:36:49.180
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay next one.

1232
03:36:50.820 --> 03:36:53.210
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Next one.

1233
03:36:53.980 --> 03:37:10.099
Natalie Hua: Yeah, Teddy, she checking. She is 6 months in her tenure. And she is really performing very well. And she availability is okay. And also the the scores is quite good.

1234
03:37:10.100 --> 03:37:31.170
Natalie Hua: And I checked with Pvp's for Jack. He she is really strong in problem solving and very good ownership on all her projects and for further developments she need to be more confident in front of senior people, and to show her cell phone

1235
03:37:31.260 --> 03:37:34.729
Natalie Hua: and all in all, she is well on track.

1236
03:37:37.690 --> 03:37:39.350
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: All right. Thank you, Mac.

1237
03:37:40.510 --> 03:37:42.639
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: This one's you from call Jeffrey.

1238
03:37:43.480 --> 03:37:48.939
Jeffrey Gao: Yeah, I think she is on track. she's doing well. that

1239
03:37:48.970 --> 03:38:06.960
Jeffrey Gao: Regarding the analytical skills that she can learn the new topic quickly and also work on the research and also generate the the analysis and findings. regarding the area for improvements. I think it's a 2 things. One thing is regarding

1240
03:38:06.960 --> 03:38:31.410
Jeffrey Gao: especially for the English nice writing. She needs to be a little bit more precise and also structured, and a signal for I think it's regarding the through the inside generation, right? So needs to push further to make some meaningful insights just to beyond what the analysis tail. So that's that's to to feedback on.

1241
03:38:32.720 --> 03:38:34.340
Jeffrey Gao: But all the contract yes.

1242
03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:44.629
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: there was. I think I think she's

1243
03:38:44.650 --> 03:38:59.539
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: but that was because there was this downtime in March. when healthcare is a slow up on what she she she she mostly did. health care, is.

1244
03:38:59.970 --> 03:39:01.740
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: It was probably one

1245
03:39:02.900 --> 03:39:03.830
SHI.42.South.06: to me.

1246
03:39:04.420 --> 03:39:05.950
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah, all right.

1247
03:39:06.190 --> 03:39:07.949
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Maybe we should.

1248
03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:27.579
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I would encourage her to get a some other Ipa, I would encourage her to get a some other Ipa.

1249
03:39:27.930 --> 03:39:29.650
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: alright,

1250
03:39:29.880 --> 03:39:31.810
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: that's why I'm

1251
03:39:33.470 --> 03:39:57.850
SHI.42.South.06: okay. So motion is on track. she actually had 3 podcasts here. I think there is one missing Cdg, input but that chapter with all the pl So she got a good feedback. probably another one as well. So her performance is pretty good. She also inputs a maturity I kind of communication of stress resistance

1252
03:39:58.070 --> 03:40:24.240
SHI.42.South.06: level or despite to slightly low mobility she's on track, and that I think she is also stopable.

1253
03:40:25.050 --> 03:40:27.980
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: her

1254
03:40:28.180 --> 03:40:44.659
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: her first case on what her fingers was was suspended. The case was suspended, I mean unexpected. So she got off the case, and afterwards I think she could be a little bit flexible in terms of the staffing, because she was

1255
03:40:44.660 --> 03:41:06.109
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: trying to wait for an auto-case to start by that case, I I mean, didn't didn't stop on time, I mean, I I think it was delayed for 3 to 4 weeks. So there was. There was also. Why, why of her availability was with low, and she also turned out once it was she used civil bullet. Another another case. So

1256
03:41:06.180 --> 03:41:08.900
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: yeah, so there was a. There was one.

1257
03:41:09.770 --> 03:41:30.790
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, and I think, you're fine. I think it's on track then. but given the local ability and and a reason, or Eric, when you communicate with with Serotonin to tell him that not to wait for in this current market situation, right? So the business situation not to wait. I will get the case at all.

1258
03:41:32.890 --> 03:41:37.900
SHI.42.South.06: otherwise it later will get hurt. I think so.

1259
03:41:39.020 --> 03:41:42.650
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. next one

1260
03:41:45.170 --> 03:41:46.859
SHI.42.South.06: covers. It's not in the room.

1261
03:41:47.160 --> 03:41:50.889
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Okay, So it's the next one while you turn to me

1262
03:41:54.800 --> 03:42:09.800
Tammy Tan: at home. you don't just came back rejo in the Bcg. from my external job. So she is just back for for for less than 2 months. I think the scores demonstrated that here the 2 3, so I

1263
03:42:09.930 --> 03:42:18.720
Tammy Tan: or she needs. she left the Bct, so the that the new data point they is the is the 2. It's a score, too. So

1264
03:42:18.720 --> 03:42:37.910
Tammy Tan: I think overall she the current to work had a cute and the skills that are on track. But actually, she asked me a question on this. she told me that because she she quit the job before she and find another job. That's why I think

1265
03:42:37.910 --> 03:42:54.889
Tammy Tan: on the first 2 cases she was on S. A. I think she called me the Pl. Probably know she's living and under the calibration scheme. she was she was calibrated to to score 3

1266
03:42:54.890 --> 03:43:22.009
Tammy Tan: she feels it may impact her promotion window in terms of essay promotion because she left at the firm for more than I think, for nearly 2 years, but did not really get any tenure credits after she came back. So basically she already have, like, 5 years it's work experience. But in terms of S. A tenure she came back with exactly the tenure before she left the Bcg.

1267
03:43:22.010 --> 03:43:24.950
Tammy Tan: so her concern is Whether

1268
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:40.960
Tammy Tan: whether we will count the the the 2 3 s. Into overall calibration of her promotion window for S. A. To C, because I've actually it's already quite long work experience for her.

1269
03:43:41.260 --> 03:43:43.209
Tammy Tan: Yeah, I understand. Right?

1270
03:43:43.360 --> 03:44:04.959
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: Yeah. I think the response to that first of all, and she still remained a 6 months. 10 years she left, and those 2 cases were still was during that time. Right? So we still have to couple it. Or in those 2 3. So we do understand, is it? It is potentially might have that potential that

1271
03:44:04.960 --> 03:44:28.429
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: those 3 are collaborated due to. She left. But we cannot make her judgment call right now. So let's see her future pro progression. And if she is really a strong performer, then we we can consider that. but if she is not, then I think 3 might be there, and also just to give everyone a background. I think it was quite

1272
03:44:28.430 --> 03:44:53.150
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: confident on herself, and also quite aggressive on her promotion before he rich? She rejoined. She asks if there is a potential for fast promotion. And then, when she joined she came to ask for a few times things things that are similar to that. So I I think what we really need to

1273
03:44:53.190 --> 03:45:01.590
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: see from her is really, get back on track get get that with us with on track performance and

1274
03:45:01.720 --> 03:45:10.090
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: strong. But, Tammy, could you also help us to manage expectation for you, Tom, because I feel like she might be over competent.

1275
03:45:10.870 --> 03:45:30.269
Tammy Tan: Oh, sure, sure, I would definitely communicate in the right way. But I can also understand her feeling, because, I think people with the I mean, what's the same PE Kia group, I mean. when she first join BC. She bus drive me CD. Are already some of them up already. Pl.

1276
03:45:30.400 --> 03:45:54.730
Tammy Tan: and she probably feels she her her past experience working outside. Pcg, that's not it not counted or so? she may not feel real that balance that I mean So so I I just want to highlight this contacts, and we we will definitely I will definitely communicate in the right way. Yeah.

1277
03:45:54.730 --> 03:46:04.850
Lin An: it's just just to I to the point. I think when our A/C's left. Pcg. the communication has been done with them that when they are coming back

1278
03:46:04.980 --> 03:46:13.699
Lin An: they will find that their peer, the same patch people will have hired tenure than them. So I think they should have this awareness.

1279
03:46:13.730 --> 03:46:15.759
Lin An: and you know, preparation.

1280
03:46:19.190 --> 03:46:27.439
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: and also actually looking back to to her a 10 year performance it's going to them in deck

1281
03:46:27.490 --> 03:46:33.459
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: it's all 3, 4, then top 3. So I I

1282
03:46:33.840 --> 03:46:38.979
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: I'm not sure if that's a fast promotion for us. So just

1283
03:46:39.090 --> 03:46:46.039
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity:  all right? let's move to next one, aaron John to me.

1284
03:46:47.290 --> 03:46:55.389
SHI.42.South.06: yeah, all right it's kind of actually she got it for for for for her first case, it's actually my real

1285
03:46:55.410 --> 03:47:00.880
SHI.42.South.06: I I talk with our Pl. It seems to be a little bit of the attitude issue.

1286
03:47:00.920 --> 03:47:07.900
SHI.42.South.06: because she's not interested in the PA. Her first case was a a a long place.

1287
03:47:08.010 --> 03:47:21.680
SHI.42.South.06: and the Po says she was actually smart, but she only delivers okay quality stuff. And the would not push herself to to the next level, and she always arrives to the office

1288
03:47:22.030 --> 03:47:25.649
SHI.42.South.06: latest in the team at least part early.

1289
03:47:25.910 --> 03:47:40.340
SHI.42.South.06: and and she also raised a a recognizing the Pto. And says something like the team work for 80 h a week, and the Pl. Said, It's actually in the bang. True. So she she's looking outside. She's got some integrity issue

1290
03:47:40.340 --> 03:48:00.159
SHI.42.South.06: and I've heard a total different story from herself, I mean, or in that I've heard of herself and she you some of because she raised a a red light in the video survey. So maybe the piano has got to be a little bit personal on, on the, on the, on the evaluation. And so I talked to her second

1291
03:48:00.160 --> 03:48:25.610
SHI.42.South.06: video, and it's seems that the performance is quite strong the the people actually wrote a a great performance on on the evaluation. So I think maybe we should. I think she's she's smart and she's being a little bit, maybe optimistic on, on, on the on the case because of the first case. She's not very interested in that, and she's not behaved.

1292
03:48:25.720 --> 03:48:31.530
SHI.42.South.06: you know. for this yourself. I hot on the second case, because that's

1293
03:48:31.570 --> 03:48:45.669
SHI.42.South.06: you know. something she's really interested in. And she really did a a great job. So maybe we should extend some kind of reminder to her, and no matter

1294
03:48:45.680 --> 03:48:52.199
SHI.42.South.06: what case, if no matter interested or or not interested, she should. really.

1295
03:48:52.300 --> 03:48:54.550
SHI.42.South.06: you know, to the off

1296
03:48:54.560 --> 03:48:58.769
SHI.42.South.06: commitment. And also, be really functional.

1297
03:48:59.580 --> 03:49:03.669
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah, it's basically what I heard from the 2 videos.

1298
03:49:06.150 --> 03:49:14.909
Tammy Tan: I'm the I'm the case Mdp on bank of Beijing. Actually, I was very surprised that for for for newcomer, who is

1299
03:49:15.110 --> 03:49:22.690
Tammy Tan: who works on the first, the case actually got picky on the case content, and they said, she is not interested.

1300
03:49:22.990 --> 03:49:43.129
Tammy Tan: I I I don't think we should really encourage that kind of attitude, and in terms of the red flag. I I mean the the the Pto. Thing. I I I don't think the Ppl. Take it personally, because actually, we investigated that

1301
03:49:43.150 --> 03:50:04.780
Tammy Tan: both. I think, David, I and I have very strong tasks with the pl, so the Po should not be concerned. That, or of this one single red eye, a red light and the only raised by one team teammate. Actually, she she was the only one who who give a red light because of too long hours.

1302
03:50:04.850 --> 03:50:21.580
Tammy Tan: I think on that case, I I I I will definitely say it's not any. There is not any any personal offense against the this. This one, I think this this score, for it's really towards the attitude issue. And the first the case now willing to

1303
03:50:21.610 --> 03:50:25.709
Tammy Tan: work with the team together. She had a pen together.

1304
03:50:28.090 --> 03:50:42.469
Tammy Tan: Actually she got on to the case on the on the second or third month of the case already. Actually, the tosses the most difficult period of the case already cost the the overall. The process is already on track

1305
03:50:42.470 --> 03:50:59.069
Tammy Tan: and the the methodology is quite clear already, and the client have very strong trust with us. We have many projects going on there. It should not be that a tough environment, or or that working long hours to to to to my degree of understanding.

1306
03:51:05.470 --> 03:51:06.260
SHI.42.South.06: Yeah.

1307
03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:08.570
SHI.42.South.06: So

1308
03:51:09.740 --> 03:51:12.520
SHI.42.South.06: so I I think she's

1309
03:51:12.590 --> 03:51:21.570
SHI.42.South.06: definitely has some solar issue, based on the, on the, on, the on the on the inputs, from the Frompo and from tension.

1310
03:51:21.700 --> 03:51:34.189
SHI.42.South.06: So it's a but it seems to have the issue of that for current case. So probably we we should discuss how how strong we we gonna extend the message to our

1311
03:51:34.320 --> 03:51:47.260
SHI.42.South.06: it is that it's gonna be a reminder that office where you from Canada. it can be a what child more serious?

1312
03:51:54.340 --> 03:51:55.070
SHI.42.South.06: Okay.

1313
03:51:55.650 --> 03:51:57.329
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: any views online

1314
03:52:00.750 --> 03:52:06.170
BEI.22.ForbiddenCity: to give a verbal warning, or maybe more serious warning, like a watch out.
